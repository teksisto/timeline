          In this Chautauqua I would like not to cut any new channels
          of consciousness but simply dig deeper into old ones that
          have become silted in with the debris of thoughts grown
          stale and platitudes too often repeated. "What's new?" is an
          interesting and broadening eternal question, but one which,
          if pursued exclusively, results only in an endless parade of
          trivia and fashion, the silt of tomorrow. I would like,
          instead, to be concerned with the question "What is best?,"
          a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, a question
          whose answers tend to move the silt downstream.

          The ideas began with what seemed to be a minor difference of
          opinion between John and me on a matter of small importance:
          how much one should maintain one's own motorcycle. It seems
          natural and normal to me to make use of the small tool kits
          and instruction booklets supplied with each machine, and
          keep it tuned and adjusted myself. John demurs. He prefers
          to let a competent mechanic take care of these things so
          that they are done right. Neither viewpoint is unusual, and
          this minor difference would never have become magnified if
          we didn't spend so much time riding together and sitting in
          country roadhouses drinking beer and talking about whatever
          comes to mind. What comes to mind, usually, is whatever
          we've been thinking about in the half hour or forty-five
          minutes since we last talked to each other. When it's roads
          or weather or people or old memories or what's in the
          newspapers, the conversation just naturally builds
          pleasantly. But whenever the performance of the machine has
          been on my mind and gets into the conversation, the building
          stops. The conversation no longer moves forward. There is a
          silence and a break in the continuity. It is as though two
          old friends, a Catholic and Protestant, were sitting
          drinking beer, enjoying life, and the subject of birth
          control somehow came up. Big freeze-out.

          And, of course, when you discover something like that it's
          like discovering a tooth with a missing filling. You can
          never leave it alone. You have to probe it, work around it,
          push on it, think about it, not because it's enjoyable but
          because it's on your mind and it won't get off your
          mind. And the more I probe and push on this subject of cycle
          maintenance the more irritated he gets, and of course that
          makes me want to probe and push all the more. Not
          deliberately to irritate him but because the irritation
          seems symptomatic of something deeper, something under the
          surface that isn't immediately apparent.

          When you're talking birth control, what blocks it and
          freezes it out is that it's not a matter of more or fewer
          babies being argued. That's just on the surface. What's
          underneath is a conflict of faith, of faith in empirical
          social planning versus faith in the authority of God as
          revealed by the teachings of the Catholic Church. You can
          prove the practicality of planned parenthood till you get
          tired of listening to yourself and it's going to go nowhere
          because your antagonist isn't buying the assumption that
          anything socially practical is good per se. Goodness for him
          has other sources which he values as much as or more than
          social practicality.

          The question why comes back again and again and has become a
          major reason for wanting to deliver this Chautauqua. Why did
          they butcher it so? These were not people running away from
          technology, like John and Sylvia. These were the
          technologists themselves. They sat down to do a job and they
          performed it like chimpanzees. Nothing personal in it. There
          was no obvious reason for it. And I tried to think back into
          that shop, that nightmare place, to try to remember anything
          that could have been the cause.

          The radio was a clue. You can't really think hard about what
          you're doing and listen to the radio at the same time. Maybe
          they didn't see their job as having anything to do with hard
          thought, just wrench twiddling. If you can twiddle wrenches
          while listening to the radio that's more enjoyable.

          Their speed was another clue. They were really slopping
          things around in a hurry and not looking where they slopped
          them. More money that way...if you don't stop to think that
          it usually takes longer or comes out worse.

          But the biggest clue seemed to be their expressions. They
          were hard to explain. Good-natured, friendly,
          easygoing...and uninvolved. They were like spectators. You
          had the feeling they had just wandered in there themselves
          and somebody had handed them a wrench. There was no
          identification with the job. No saying, "I am a mechanic."
          At 5 P.M. or whenever their eight hours were in, you knew
          they would cut it off and not have another thought about
          their work. They were already trying not to have any
          thoughts about their work on the job. In their own way they
          were achieving the same thing John and Sylvia were, living
          with technology without really having anything to do with
          it. Or rather, they had something to do with it, but their
          own selves were outside of it, detached, removed. They were
          involved in it but not in such a way as to care.

          While at work I was thinking about this same lack of care in
          the digital computer manuals I was editing. Writing and
          editing technical manuals is what I do for a living the
          other eleven months of the year and I knew they were full of
          errors, ambiguities, omissions and information so completely
          screwed up you had to read them six times to make any sense
          out of them. But what struck me for the first time was the
          agreement of these manuals with the spectator attitude I had
          seen in the shop. These were spectator manuals. It was built
          into the format of them. Implicit in every line is the idea
          that "Here is the machine, isolated in time and in space
          from everything else in the universe. It has no relationship
          to you, you have no relationship to it, other than to turn
          certain switches, maintain voltage levels, check for error
          conditions--" and so on. That's it. The mechanics in their
          attitude toward the machine were really taking no different
          attitude from the manual's toward the machine, or from the
          attitude I had when I brought it in there. We were all
          spectators. And it occurred to me there is no manual that
          deals with the real business of motorcycle maintenance, the
          most important aspect of all. Caring about what you are
          doing is considered either unimportant or taken for granted.

          On this trip I think we should notice it, explore it a
          little, to see if in that strange separation of what man is
          from what man does we may have some clues as to what the
          hell has gone wrong in this twentieth century. I don't want
          to hurry it. That itself is a poisonous twentieth-century
          attitude. When you want to hurry something, that means you
          no longer care about it and want to get on to other
          things. I just want to get at it slowly, but carefully and
          thoroughly, with the same attitude I remember was present
          just before I found that sheared pin. It was that attitude
          that found it, nothing else.

          "Do you believe in ghosts?"

          "No," I say

          "Why not?"

          "Because they are un-sci-en-ti-fic."

          The way I say this makes John smile. "They contain no
          matter," I continue, "and have no energy and therefore,
          according to the laws of science, do not exist except in
          people's minds."

          The whiskey, the fatigue and the wind in the trees start
          mixing in my mind. "Of course," I add, "the laws of science
          contain no matter and have no energy either and therefore do
          not exist except in people's minds. It's best to be
          completely scientific about the whole thing and refuse to
          believe in either ghosts or the laws of science. That way
          you're safe. That doesn't leave you very much to believe in,
          but that's scientific too."

          "I don't know what you're talking about," Chris says.

          "I'm being kind of facetious."

          Chris gets frustrated when I talk like this, but I don't
          think it hurts him.

          "One of the kids at YMCA camp says he believes in ghosts."

          "He was just spoofing you."

          "No, he wasn't. He said that when people haven't been buried
          right, their ghosts come back to haunt people. He really
          believes in that."

          "He was just spoofing you," I repeat.

          "What's his name?" Sylvia says.

          "Tom White Bear."

          John and I exchange looks, suddenly recognizing the same
          thing.

          "Ohhh, Indian!" he says.

          I laugh. "I guess I'm going to have to take that back a
          little," I say. "I was thinking of European ghosts."

          "What's the difference?"

          John roars with laughter. "He's got you," he says.

          I think a little and say, "Well, Indians sometimes have a
          different way of looking at things, which I'm not saying is
          completely wrong. Science isn't part of the Indian
          tradition."

          "Tom White Bear said his mother and dad told him not to
          believe all that stuff. But he said his grandmother
          whispered it was true anyway, so he believes it."

          He looks at me pleadingly. He really does want to know
          things sometimes. Being facetious is not being a very good
          father. "Sure," I say, reversing myself, "I believe in
          ghosts too."

          Now John and Sylvia look at me peculiarly. I see I'm not
          going to get out of this one easily and brace myself for a
          long explanation.

          "It's completely natural," I say, "to think of Europeans who
          believed in ghosts or Indians who believed in ghosts as
          ignorant. The scientific point of view has wiped out every
          other view to a point where they all seem primitive, so that
          if a person today talks about ghosts or spirits he is
          considered ignorant or maybe nutty. It's just all but
          completely impossible to imagine a world where ghosts can
          actually exist."

          John nods affirmatively and I continue.

          "My own opinion is that the intellect of modern man isn't
          that superior. IQs aren't that much different. Those Indians
          and medieval men were just as intelligent as we are, but the
          context in which they thought was completely
          different. Within that context of thought, ghosts and
          spirits are quite as real as atoms, particles, photons and
          quants are to a modern man. In that sense I believe in
          ghosts. Modern man has his ghosts and spirits too, you
          know."

          "What?"

          "Oh, the laws of physics and of logic -- the number system
          --the principle of algebraic substitution. These are
          ghosts. We just believe in them so thoroughly they seem
          real.

          "They seem real to me," John says.

          "I don't get it," says Chris.

          So I go on. "For example, it seems completely natural to
          presume that gravitation and the law of gravitation existed
          before Isaac Newton. It would sound nutty to think that
          until the seventeenth century there was no gravity."

          "Of course."

          "So when did this law start? Has it always existed?"

          John is frowning, wondering what I am getting at.

          "What I'm driving at," I say, "is the notion that before the
          beginning of the earth, before the sun and the stars were
          formed, before the primal generation of anything, the law of
          gravity existed."

          "Sure."

          "Sitting there, having no mass of its own, no energy of its
          own, not in anyone's mind because there wasn't anyone, not
          in space because there was no space either, not
          anywhere...this law of gravity still existed?"

          Now John seems not so sure.

          "If that law of gravity existed," I say, "I honestly don't
          know what a thing has to do to be nonexistent. It seems to
          me that law of gravity has passed every test of nonexistence
          there is. You cannot think of a single attribute of
          nonexistence that that law of gravity didn't have. Or a
          single scientific attribute of existence it did have. And
          yet it is still -- common sense' to believe that it existed."

          John says, "I guess I'd have to think about it."

          "Well, I predict that if you think about it long enough you
          will find yourself going round and round and round and round
          until you finally reach only one possible, rational,
          intelligent conclusion. The law of gravity and gravity
          itself did not exist before Isaac Newton. No other
          conclusion makes sense.

          "And what that means," I say before he can interrupt, "and
          what that means is that that law of gravity exists nowhere
          except in people's heads! It's a ghost! We are all of us
          very arrogant and conceited about running down other
          people's ghosts but just as ignorant and barbaric and
          superstitious about our own."

          "Why does everybody believe in the law of gravity then?"

          "Mass hypnosis. In a very orthodox form known as
          "education.""

          "You mean the teacher is hypnotizing the kids into believing
          the law of gravity?"

          "Sure."

          "That's absurd."

          "You've heard of the importance of eye contact in the
          classroom? Every educationist emphasizes it. No educationist
          explains it."

          John shakes his head and pours me another drink. He puts his
          hand over his mouth and in a mock aside says to Sylvia, "You
          know, most of the time he seems like such a normal guy."

          I counter, "That's the first normal thing I've said in
          weeks. The rest of the time I'm feigning twentieth-

          century lunacy just like you are. So as not to draw
          attention to myself.

          "But I'll repeat it for you," I say. "We believe the
          disembodied words of Sir Isaac Newton were sitting in the
          middle of nowhere billions of years before he was born and
          that magically he discovered these words. They were always
          there, even when they applied to nothing. Gradually the
          world came into being and then they applied to it. In fact,
          those words themselves were what formed the world. That,
          John, is ridiculous.

          "The problem, the contradiction the scientists are stuck
          with, is that of mind. Mind has no matter or energy but they
          can't escape its predominance over everything they do. Logic
          exists in the mind. Numbers exist only in the mind. I don't
          get upset when scientists say that ghosts exist in the
          mind. It's that only that gets me. Science is only in your
          mind too, it's just that that doesn't make it bad. Or ghosts
          either."

          They are just looking at me so I continue: "Laws of nature
          are human inventions, like ghosts. Laws of logic, of
          mathematics are also human inventions, like ghosts. The
          whole blessed thing is a human invention, including the idea
          that it isn't a human invention. The world has no existence
          whatsoever outside the human imagination. It's all a ghost,
          and in antiquity was so recognized as a ghost, the whole
          blessed world we live in. It's run by ghosts. We see what we
          see because these ghosts show it to us, ghosts of Moses and
          Christ and the Buddha, and Plato, and Descartes, and
          Rousseau and Jefferson and Lincoln, on and on and on. Isaac
          Newton is a very good ghost. One of the best. Your common
          sense is nothing more than the voices of thousands and
          thousands of these ghosts from the past. Ghosts and more
          ghosts. Ghosts trying to find their place among the living."

          you in. These are some British laminated plate-glass goggles
          that work fine. The wind getsbehind sunglasses. Plastic

          A copy of Thoreau's Walden -- which Chris has never heard and
          which can be read a hundred times without exhaustion. I try
          always to pick a book far over his head and read it as a
          basis for questions and answers, rather than without
          interruption. I read a sentence or two, wait for him to come
          up with his usual barrage of questions, answer them, then
          read another sentence or two. Classics read well this
          way. They must be written this way. Sometimes we have spent
          a whole evening reading and talking and discovered we have
          only covered two or three pages.

          It was cold all right, but not that cold. How do John and
          Sylvia ever get through Minnesota winters? I wonder. There's
          kind of a glaring inconsistency here, that's almost too
          obvious to dwell on. If they can't stand physical discomfort
          and they can't stand technology, they've got a little
          compromising to do. They depend on technology and condemn it
          at the same time. I'm sure they know that and that just
          contributes to their dislike of the whole situation. They're
          not presenting a logical thesis, they're just reporting how
          it is. But three farmers are coming into town now, rounding
          the corner in that brand-new pickup truck. I'll bet with
          them it's just the other way around. They're going to show
          off that truck and their tractor and that new washing
          machine and they'll have the tools to fix them if they go
          wrong, and know how to use the tools. They value
          technology. And they're the ones who need it the least. If
          all technology stopped, tomorrow, these people would know
          how to make out. It would be rough, but they'd survive. John
          and Sylvia and Chris and I would be dead in a week. This
          condemnation of technology is ingratitude, that's what it
          is.

          Blind alley, though. If somone's ungrateful and you tell him
          he's ungrateful, okay, you've called him a name. You haven't
          solved anything.

          At Herreid John disappears for a drink while Sylvia and
          Chris and I find some shade in a park and try to rest. It
          isn't restful. A change has taken place and I don't know
          quite what it is. The streets of this town are broad, much
          broader than they need be, and there is a pallor of dust in
          the air. Empty lots here and there between the buildings
          have weeds growing in them. The sheet metal equipment sheds
          and water tower are like those of previous towns but more
          spread out. Everything is more run-down and
          mechanical-looking, and sort of randomly located. Gradually
          I see what it is. Nobody is concerned anymore about tidily
          conserving space. The land isn't valuable anymore. We are in
          a Western town.

          He didn't really see what was going on and was not interested
          enough to find out. He isn't so interested in what things
          mean as in what they are. That's quite important, that he
          sees things this way. It took me a long time to see this
          difference and it's important for the Chautauqua that I make
          this difference clear.

          I was so baffled by his refusal even to think about any
          mechanical subject I kept searching for ways to clue him to
          the whole thing but didn't know where to start.

          I thought I would wait until something went wrong with his
          machine and then I would help him fix it and that way get
          him into it, but I goofed that one myself because I didn't
          understand this difference in the way he looked at things.

          His handlebars had started slipping. Not badly, he said,
          just a little when you shoved hard on them. I warned him not
          to use his adjustable wrench on the tightening nuts. It was
          likely to damage the chrome and start small rust spots. He
          agreed to use my metric sockets and box-ends.

          When he brought his motorcycle over I got my wrenches out
          but then noticed that no amount of tightening would stop the
          slippage, because the ends of the collars were pinched shut.

          "You're going to have to shim those out," I said.

          "What's shim?"

          "It's a thin, flat strip of metal. You just slip it around
          the handlebar under the collar there and it will open up the
          collar to where you can tighten it again. You use shims like
          that to make adjustments in all kinds of machines."

          "Oh," he said. He was getting interested. "Good. Where do
          you buy them?"

          "I've got some right here," I said gleefully, holding up a
          can of beer in my hand.

          He didn't understand for a moment. Then he said, "What, the
          can?"

          "Sure," I said, "best shim stock in the world."

          I thought this was pretty clever myself. Save him a trip to
          God knows where to get shim stock. Save him time. Save him
          money.

          But to my surprise he didn't see the cleverness of this at
          all. In fact he got noticeably haughty about the whole
          thing. Pretty soon he was dodging and filling with all kinds
          of excuses and, before I realized what his real attitude
          was, we had decided not to fix the handlebars after all.

          As far as I know those handlebars are still loose. And I
          believe now that he was actually offended at the time. I had
          had the nerve to propose repair of his new eighteen-hundred
          dollar BMW, the pride of a half-century of German mechanical
          finesse, with a piece of old beer can!

          Ach, du lieber!

          Since then we have had very few conversations about
          motorcycle maintenance. None, now that I think of it.

          You push it any further and suddenly you are angry, without
          knowing why.

          I should say, to explain this, that beer-can aluminum is
          soft and sticky, as metals go. Perfect for the
          application. Aluminum doesn't oxidize in wet weather...or,
          more precisely, it always has a thin layer of oxide that
          prevents any further oxidation. Also perfect.

          In other words, any true German mechanic, with a
          half-century of mechanical finesse behind him, would have
          concluded that this particular solution to this particular
          technical problem was perfect.

          For a while I thought what I should have done was sneak over
          to the workbench, cut a shim from the beer can, remove the
          printing and then come back and tell him we were in luck, it
          was the last one I had, specially imported from
          Germany. That would have done it. A special shim from the
          private stock of Baron Alfred Krupp, who had to sell it at a
          great sacrifice. Then he would have gone gaga over it.

          That Krupp's-private-shim fantasy gratified me for a while,
          but then it wore off and I saw it was just being
          vindictive. In its place grew that old feeling I've talked
          about before, a feeling that there's something bigger
          involved than is apparent on the surface. You follow these
          little discrepancies long enough and they sometimes open up
          into huge revelations. There was just a feeling on my part
          that this was something a little bigger than I wanted to
          take on without thinking about it, and I turned instead to
          my usual habit of trying to extract causes and effects to
          see what was involved that could possibly lead to such an
          impasse between John's view of that lovely shim and my
          own. This comes up all the time in mechanical work. A
          hang-up. You just sit and stare and think, and search
          randomly for new information, and go away and come back
          again, and after a while the unseen factors start to emerge.

          What emerged in vague form at first and then in sharper
          outline was the explanation that I had been seeing that shim
          in a kind of intellectual, rational, cerebral way in which
          the scientific properties of the metal were all that
          counted. John was going at it immediately and intuitively,
          grooving on it. I was going at it in terms of underlying
          form. He was going at it in terms of immediate appearance. I
          was seeing what the shim meant. He was seeing what the shim
          was. That's how I arrived at that distinction. And when you
          see what the shim is,in this case, it's depressing. Who
          likes to think of a beautiful precision machine fixed with
          an old hunk of junk?

          I guess I forgot to mention John is a musician, a drummer,
          who works with groups all over town and makes a pretty fair
          income from it. I suppose he just thinks about everything
          the way he thinks about drumming...which is to say he
          doesn't really think about it at all. He just does it. Is
          with it. He just responded to fixing his motorcycle with a
          beer can the way he would respond to someone dragging the
          beat while he was playing. It just did a big thud with him
          and that was it. He didn't want any part of it.

          At first this difference seemed fairly minor, but then it
          grew -- and grew -- and grew -- until I began to see why I
          missed it. Some things you miss because they're so tiny you
          overlook them. But some things you don't see because they're
          so huge. We were both looking at the same thing, seeing the
          same thing, talking about the same thing, thinking about the
          same thing, except he was looking, seeing, talking and
          thinking from a completely different dimension.

          He really does care about technology. It's just that in this
          other dimension he gets all screwed up and is rebuffed by
          it. It just won't swing for him. He tries to swing it
          without any rational premeditation and botches it and
          botches it and botches it and after so many botches gives up
          and just kind of puts a blanket curse on that whole
          nuts-and-bolts scene. He will not or cannot believe there is
          anything in this world for which grooving is not the way to
          go.

          That's the dimension he's in. The groovy dimension. I'm
          being awfully square talking about all this mechanical stuff
          all the time. It's all just parts and relationships and
          analyses and syntheses and figuring things out and it isn't
          really here. It's somewhere else, which thinks it's here,
          but's a million miles away. This is what it's all
          about. He's on this dimensional difference which underlay
          much of the cultural changes of the sixties, I think, and is
          still in the process of reshaping our whole national outlook
          on things. The "generation gap" has been a result of it. The
          names "beat" and "hip" grew out of it. Now it's become
          apparent that this dimension isn't a fad that's going to go
          away next year or the year after. It's here to stay because
          it's a very serious and important way of looking at things
          that looks incompatible with reason and order and
          responsibility but actually is not. Now we are down to the
          root of things.

          What we have here is a conflict of visions of reality. The
          world as you see it right here, right now, is reality,
          regardless of what the scientists say it might be. That's
          the way John sees it. But the world as revealed by its
          scientific discoveries is also reality, regardless of how it
          may appear, and people in John's dimension are going to have
          to do more than just ignore it if they want to hang on to
          their vision of reality. John will discover this if his
          points burn out.

          That's really why he got upset that day when he couldn't get
          his engine started. It was an intrusion on his reality. It
          just blew a hole right through his whole groovy way of
          looking at things and he would not face up to it because it
          seemed to threaten his whole life style. In a way he was
          experiencing the same sort of anger scientific people have
          sometimes about abstract art, or at least used to have. That
          didn't fit their life style either.

          What you've got here, really, are two realities, one of
          immediate artistic appearance and one of underlying
          scientific explanation, and they don't match and they don't
          fit and they don't really have much of anything to do with
          one another. That's quite a situation. You might say there's
          a little problem here.

          And in the fog there appears an intimation of a figure. It
          disappears when I look at it directly, but then reappears in
          the corner of my vision when I turn my glance. I am about to
          say something, to call to it, to recognize it, but then do
          not, knowing that to recognize it by any gesture or action
          is to give it a reality which it must not have. But it is a
          figure I recognize even though I do not let on. It is
          Phædrus.

          Evil spirit. Insane. From a world without life or death.

          The figure fades and I hold panic down -- tight -- not rushing
          it -- just letting it sink in -- not believing it, not
          disbelieving it -- but the hair crawls slowly on the back of my
          skull -- he is calling Chris, is that it? -- Yes? --

          Back in Minnesota when we were traveling through some
          marshland I did some talking about the "shapes" of
          technology, the "death force" that the Sutherlands seem to
          be running from. I want to move now in the opposite
          direction from the Sutherlands, toward that force and into
          its center. In doing so we will be entering Phædrus' world,
          the only world he ever knew, in which all understanding is
          in terms of underlying form.

          The world of underlying form is an unusual object of
          discussion because it is actually a mode of discussion
          itself. You discuss things in terms of their immediate
          appearance or you discuss them in terms of their underlying
          form, and when you try to discuss these modes of discussion
          you get involved in what could be called a platform
          problem. You have no platform from which to discuss them
          other than the modes themselves.

          Previously I was discussing his world of underlying form, or
          at least the aspect of it called technology, from an
          external view. Now I think it's right to talk about that
          world of underlying form from its own point of view. I want
          to talk about the underlying form of the world of underlying
          form itself.

          To do this, first of all, a dichotomy is necessary, but
          before I can use it honestly I have to back up and say what
          it is and means, and that is a long story in itself. Part of
          this back-up problem. But right now I just want to use a
          dichotomy and explain it later. I want to divide human
          understanding into two kinds...classical understanding and
          romantic understanding. In terms of ultimate truth a
          dichotomy of this sort has little meaning but it is quite
          legitimate when one is operating within the classic mode
          used to discover or create a world of underlying form. The
          terms classic and romantic, as Phædrus used them, mean the
          following:

          A classical understanding sees the world primarily as
          underlying form itself. A romantic understanding sees it
          primarily in terms of immediate appearance. If you were to
          show an engine or a mechanical drawing or electronic
          schematic to a romantic it is unlikely he would see much of
          interest in it. It has no appeal because the reality he sees
          is its surface. Dull, complex lists of names, lines and
          numbers. Nothing interesting. But if you were to show the
          same blueprint or schematic or give the same description to
          a classical person he might look at it and then become
          fascinated by it because he sees that within the lines and
          shapes and symbols is a tremendous richness of underlying
          form.

          The romantic mode is primarily inspirational, imaginative,
          creative, intuitive. Feelings rather than facts
          predominate. "Art" when it is opposed to "Science" is often
          romantic. It does not proceed by reason or by laws. It
          proceeds by feeling, intuition and esthetic conscience. In
          the northern European cultures the romantic mode is usually
          associated with femininity, but this is certainly not a
          necessary association.

          The classic mode, by contrast, proceeds by reason and by
          laws...which are themselves underlying forms of thought and
          behavior. In the European cultures it is primarily a
          masculine mode and the fields of science, law and medicine
          are unattractive to women largely for this reason. Although
          motorcycle riding is romantic, motorcycle maintenance is
          purely classic. The dirt, the grease, the mastery of
          underlying form required all give it such a negative
          romantic appeal that women never go near it.

          Although surface ugliness is often found in the classic mode
          of understanding it is not inherent in it. There is a
          classic esthetic which romantics often miss because of its
          subtlety. The classic style is straightforward, unadorned,
          unemotional, economical and carefully proportioned. Its
          purpose is not to inspire emotionally, but to bring order
          out of chaos and make the unknown known. It is not an
          esthet- ically free and natural style. It is esthetically
          restrained. Everything is under control. Its value is
          measured in terms of the skill with which this control is
          maintained.

          To a romantic this classic mode often appears dull, awkward
          and ugly, like mechanical maintenance itself. Everything is
          in terms of pieces and parts and components and
          relationships. Nothing is figured out until it's run through
          the computer a dozen times. Everything's got to be measured
          and proved. Oppressive. Heavy. Endlessly grey. The death
          force.

          Within the classic mode, however, the romantic has some
          appearances of his own. Frivolous, irrational, erratic,
          untrustworthy, interested primarily in
          pleasure-seeking. Shallow. Of no substance. Often a parasite
          who cannot or will not carry his own weight. A real drag on
          society. By now these battle lines should sound a little
          familiar.

          This is the source of the trouble. Persons tend to think and
          feel exclusively in one mode or the other and in doing so
          tend to misunderstand and underestimate what the other mode
          is all about. But no one is willing to give up the truth as
          he sees it, and as far as I know, no one now living has any
          real reconciliation of these truths or modes. There is no
          point at which these visions of reality are unified.

          And so in recent times we have seen a huge split develop
          between a classic culture and a romantic
          counterculture...two worlds growingly alienated and hateful
          toward each other with everyone wondering if it will always
          be this way, a house divided against itself. No one wants it
          really...despite what his antagonists in the other dimension
          might think.

          It is within this context that what Phædrus thought and said
          is significant. But no one was listening at that time and
          they only thought him eccentric at first, then undesirable,
          then slightly mad, and then genuinely insane. There seems
          little doubt that he was insane, but much of his writing at
          the time indicates that what was driving him insane was this
          hostile opinion of him. Unusual behavior tends to produce
          estrangement in others which tends to further the unusual
          behavior and thus the estrangement in self-stoking cycles
          until some sort of climax is reached. In Phædrus' case there
          was a court-ordered police arrest and permanent removal from
          society.

          His kind of rationality has been used since antiquity to
          remove oneself from the tedium and depression of one's
          immediate surroundings. What makes it hard to see is that
          where once it was used to get away from it all, the escape
          has been so successful that now it is the "it all" that the
          romantics are trying to escape. What makes his world so hard
          to see clearly is not its strangeness but its
          usualness. Familiarity can blind you too.

          His way of looking at things produces a kind of description
          that can be called an "analytic" description. That is
          another name of the classic platform from which one
          discusses things in terms of their underlying form. He was a
          totally classic person. And to give a fuller description of
          what this is I want now to turn his analytic approach back
          upon itself...to analyze analysis itself.

          There's certainly nothing strange about this description at
          first hearing. It sounds like something from a beginning
          textbook on the subject, or perhaps a first lesson in a
          vocational course. What is unusual about it is seen when it
          ceases to be a mode of discourse and becomes an object of
          discourse. Then certain things can be pointed to.

          The first thing to be observed about this description is so
          obvious you have to hold it down or it will drown out every
          other observation. This is: It is just duller than
          ditchwater. Yah-da, yah-da, yah-da, yah-da, yah, carburetor,
          gear ratio, compression, yah-da-yah, piston, plugs, intake,
          yah-da-yah, on and on and on. That is the romantic face of
          the classic mode. Dull, awkward and ugly. Few romantics get
          beyond that point.

          But if you can hold down that most obvious observation, some
          other things can be noticed that do not at first appear.

          The first is that the motorcycle, so described, is almost
          impossible to understand unless you already know how one
          works. The immediate surface impressions that are essential
          for primary understanding are gone. Only the underlying form
          is left.

          The second is that the observer is missing. The description
          doesn't say that to see the piston you must remove the
          cylinder head. "You" aren't anywhere in the picture. Even
          the "operator" is a kind of personalityless robot whose
          performance of a function on the machine is completely
          mechanical. There are no real subjects in this
          description. Only objects exist that are independent of any
          observer.

          The third is that the words "good" and "bad" and all their
          synonyms are completely absent. No value judgments have been
          expressed anywhere, only facts.

          The fourth is that there is a knife moving here. A very
          deadly one; an intellectual scalpel so swift and so sharp
          you sometimes don't see it moving. You get the illusion that
          all those parts are just there and are being named as they
          exist. But they can be named quite differently and organized
          quite differently depending on how the knife moves.

          No one ever saw this, I don't think he even saw it himself,
          and it may be an illusion of my own, but the knife he used
          was less that of an assassin than that of a poor
          surgeon. Perhaps there is no difference. But he saw a sick
          and ailing thing happening and he started cutting deep,
          deeper and deeper to get at the root of it. He was after
          something. That is important. He was after something and he
          used the knife because that was the only tool he had.

          The application of this knife, the division of the world
          into parts and the building of this structure, is something
          everybody does. All the time we are aware of millions of
          things around us...these changing shapes, these burning
          hills, the sound of the engine, the feel of the throttle,
          each rock and weed and fence post and piece of debris beside
          the road...aware of these things but not really conscious of
          them unless there is something unusual or unless they
          reflect something we are predisposed to see. We could not
          possibly be conscious of these things and remember all of
          them because our mind would be so full of useless details we
          would be unable to think. From all this awareness we must
          select, and what we select and call consciousness is never
          the same as the awareness because the process of selection
          mutates it. We take a handful of sand from the endless
          landscape of awareness around us and call that handful of
          sand the world.

          Once we have the handful of sand, the world of which we are
          conscious, a process of discrimination goes to work on
          it. This is the knife. We divide the sand into parts. This
          and that. Here and there. Black and white. Now and then. The
          discrimination is the division of the conscious universe
          into parts.

          The handful of sand looks uniform at first, but the longer
          we look at it the more diverse we find it to be. Each grain
          of sand is different. No two are alike. Some are similar in
          one way, some are similar in another way, and we can form
          the sand into separate piles on the basis of this similarity
          and dissimilarity. Shades of color in different
          piles...sizes in different piles...grain shapes in different
          piles...subtypes of grain shapes in different piles...grades
          of opacity in different piles...and so on, and on, and
          on. You'd think the process of subdivision and
          classification would come to an end somewhere, but it
          doesn't. It just goes on and on.

          Classical understanding is concerned with the piles and the
          basis for sorting and interrelating them. Romantic
          understanding is directed toward the handful of sand before
          the sorting begins. Both are valid ways of looking at the
          world although irreconcilable with each other.

          What has become an urgent necessity is a way of looking at
          the world that does violence to neither of these two kinds
          of understanding and unites them into one. Such an
          understanding will not reject sand-sorting or contemplation
          of unsorted sand for its own sake. Such an understanding
          will instead seek to direct attention to the endless
          landscape from which the sand is taken. That is what
          Phædrus, the poor surgeon, was trying to do.

          To understand what he was trying to do it's necessary to see
          that part of the landscape, inseparable from it, which must
          be understood, is a figure in the middle of it, sorting sand
          into piles. To see the landscape without seeing this figure
          is not to see the landscape at all.

          There is a perennial classical question that asks which part
          of the motorcycle, which grain of sand in which pile, is the
          Buddha. Obviously to ask that question is to look in the
          wrong direction, for the Buddha is everywhere. But just as
          obviously to ask that question is to look in the right
          direction, for the Buddha is everywhere. About the Buddha
          that exists independently of any analytic thought much has
          been said...some would say too much, and would question any
          attempt to add to it. But about the Buddha that exists
          within analytic thought, and gives that analytic thought its
          direction, virtually nothing has been said, and there are
          historic reasons for this. But history keeps happening, and
          it seems no harm and maybe some positive good to add to our
          historical heritage with some talk in this area of
          discourse.

          When analytic thought, the knife, is applied to experience,
          something is always killed in the process. That is fairly
          well understood, at least in the arts. Mark Twain's
          experience comes to mind, in which, after he had mastered
          the analytic knowledge needed to pilot the Mississippi
          River, he discovered the river had lost its
          beauty. Something is always killed. But what is less noticed
          in the arts...something is always created too. And instead
          of just dwelling on what is killed it's important also to
          see what's created and to see the process as a kind of
          death-birth continuity that is neither good nor bad, but
          just is.

          one access to him that I can see as passable and we still
          have a way to go.

          I told Chris the other night that Phædrus spent his entire
          life pursuing a ghost. That was true. The ghost he pursued
          was the ghost that underlies all of technology, all of
          modern science, all of Western thought. It was the ghost of
          rationality itself. I told Chris that he found the ghost and
          that when he found it he thrashed it good. I think in a
          figurative sense that is true. The things I hope to bring to
          light as we go along are some of the things he
          uncovered. Now the times are such that others may at last
          find them of value. No one then would see the ghost that
          Phædrus pursued, but I think now that more and more people
          see it, or get glimpses of it in bad moments, a ghost which
          calls itself rationality but whose appearance is that of
          incoherence and meaninglessness, which causes the most
          normal of everyday acts to seem slightly mad because of
          their irrelevance to anything else. This is the ghost of
          normal everyday assumptions which declares that the ultimate
          purpose of life, which is to keep alive, is impossible, but
          that this is the ultimate purpose of life anyway, so that
          great minds struggle to cure diseases so that people may
          live longer, but only madmen ask why. One lives longer in
          order that he may live longer. There is no other
          purpose. That is what the ghost says.

          No one really knew him. That is evidently the way he wanted

          I think his pursuit of the ghost of rationality occurred

          He was dead. Destroyed by order of the court, enforced by
          the transmission of high-voltage alternating current through
          the lobes of his brain. Approximately 800 mills of amperage
          at durations of 0.5 to 1.5 seconds had been applied on
          twenty-eight consecutive occasions, in a process known
          technologically as "Annihilation ECS." A whole personality
          had been liquidated without a trace in a technologically
          faultless act that has defined our relationship ever
          since. I have never met him. Never will.

          And yet strange wisps of his memory suddenly match and fit
          this road and desert bluffs and white-hot sand all around us
          and there is a bizarre concurrence and then I know he has
          seen all of this. He was here, otherwise I would not know
          it. He had to be. And in seeing these sudden coalescences of
          vision and in recall of some strange fragment of thought
          whose origin I have no idea of, I'm like a clairvoyant, a
          spirit medium receiving messages from another world. That is
          how it is. I see things with my own eyes, and I see things
          with his eyes too. He once owned them.

          These EYES! That is the terror of it. These gloved hands I
          now look at, steering the motorcycle down the road, were
          once his! And if you can understand the feeling that comes
          from that, then you can understand real fear...the fear that
          comes from knowing there is nowhere you can possibly run.

          Not everyone understands what a completely rational process
          this is, this maintenance of a motorcycle. They think it's
          some kind of a "knack" or some kind of "affinity for
          machines" in operation. They are right, but the knack is
          almost purely a process of reason, and most of the troubles
          are caused by what old time radio men called a "short
          between the earphones," failures to use the head properly. A
          motorcycle functions entirely in accordance with the laws of
          reason, and a study of the art of motorcycle maintenance is
          really a miniature study of the art of rationality itself. I
          said yesterday that the ghost of rationality was what
          Phædrus pursued and what led to his insanity, but to get
          into that it's vital to stay with down-to-earth examples of
          rationality, so as not to get lost in generalities no one
          else can understand. Talk about rationality can get very
          confusing unless the things with which rationality deals are
          also included.

          Precision instruments are designed to achieve an idea,
          dimensional precision, whose perfection is impossible. There
          is no perfectly shaped part of the motorcycle and never will
          be, but when you come as close as these instruments take

          To speak of certain government and establishment
          institutions as "the system" is to speak correctly, since
          these organizations are founded upon the same structural
          conceptual relationships as a motorcycle. They are sustained
          by structural relationships even when they have lost all
          other meaning and purpose. People arrive at a factory and
          perform a totally meaningless task from eight to five
          without question because the structure demands that it be
          that way. There's no villain, no "mean guy" who wants them
          to live meaningless lives, it's just that the structure, the
          system demands it and no one is willing to take on the
          formidable task of changing the structure just because it is
          meaningless.

          But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a government
          or to avoid repair of a motorcycle because it is a system is
          to attack effects rather than causes; and as long as the
          attack is upon effects only, no change is possible. The true
          system, the real system, is our present construction of
          systematic thought itself, rationality itself, and if a
          factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it
          is left standing, then that rationality will simply produce
          another factory. If a revolution destroys a systematic
          government, but the systematic patterns of thought that
          produced that government are left intact, then those
          patterns will repeat themselves in the succeeding
          government. There's so much talk about the system. And so
          little understanding.

          I've noticed that people who have never worked with steel
          have trouble seeing this...that the motorcycle is primarily
          a mental phenomenon. They associate metal with given
          shapes...pipes, rods, girders, tools, parts...all of them
          fixed and inviolable, and think of it as primarily
          physical. But a person who does machining or foundry work or
          forge work or welding sees "steel" as having no shape at
          all. Steel can be any shape you want if you are skilled
          enough, and any shape but the one you want if you are
          not. Shapes, like this tappet, are what you arrive at, what
          you give to the steel. Steel has no more shape than this old
          pile of dirt on the engine here. These shapes are all out of
          someone's mind. That's important to see. The steel? Hell,
          even the steel is out of someone's mind. There's no steel in
          nature. Anyone from the Bronze Age could have told you
          that. All nature has is a potential for steel. There's
          nothing else there. But what's "potential"? That's also in
          someone's mind! -- Ghosts.

          That's really what Phædrus was talking about when he said
          it's all in the mind. It sounds insane when you just jump up
          and say it without reference to anything specific like an
          engine. But when you tie it down to something specific and
          concrete, the insane sound tends to disappear and you see he
          could have been saying something of importance.

          Inside I see that Bill is a mechanic of the "photographic
          mind" school. Everything lying around everywhere. Wrenches,
          screwdrivers, old parts, old motorcycles, new parts, new
          motorcycles, sales literature, inner tubes, all scattered so
          thickly and clutteredly you can't even see the workbenches
          under them. I couldn't work in conditions like this but
          that's just because I'm not a photographic-mind
          mechanic. Bill can probably turn around and put his hand on
          any tool in this mess without having to think about where it
          is. I've seen mechanics like that. Drive you crazy to watch
          them, but they get the job done just as well and sometimes
          faster. Move one tool three inches to the left though, and
          he'll have to spend days looking for it.

          He's got to close a deal out in back on some Harley parts. I
          go with him out in a shed in back and see he is selling a
          whole Harley machine in used parts, except for the frame,
          which the customer already has. He is selling them all for
          $125. Not a bad price at all.

          Coming back I comment, "He'll know something about

          "This is a great town," John says, "really great. Surprised
          there were any like this left. I was looking all over this
          morning. They've got stockmen's bars, high-top boots,
          silver-dollar belt buckles, Levis, Stetsons, the whole thing
          -- and it's real. It isn't just Chamber of Commerce

          John continues. "And this one old guy was talking away about
          how he wasn't going to give a thing to the goddam boys, and
          I really enjoyed that. The ranch was going to go to the
          girls, cause the goddam boys spend every cent they got down
          at Suzie's." John breaks up with laughter. "Sorry he ever

          thirty years ago, but it's still here."

          "Something else that ought to interest you," John
          says. "They were talking in the bar about Bozeman, where
          we're going. They said the governor of Montana had a list of
          fifty radical college professors at the college in Bozeman
          he was going to fire. Then he got killed in a plane crash."

          "That was a long time ago," I answer. These steaks really
          are good.

          "I didn't know they had a lot of radicals in this state."

          "They've got all kinds of people in this state," I say. "But
          that was just right-wing politics."

          John helps himself to some more salt. He says, "A Washington
          newspaper columnist came through and put it in his column
          yesterday, and that's why they were all talking about
          it. The president of the college confirmed it."

          "Did they print the list?"

          "I don't know. Did you know any of them?"

          "If they had fifty names," I say, "mine must have been one."
          They both look at me with some surprise. I don't know much
          about it, actually. It was him, of course, and with some
          feeling of falseness because of this I explain that a
          "radical" in Gallatin County, Montana, is a little different
          from a radical somewhere else.

          "This was a college," I tell them, "where the wife of the
          president of the United States was actually banned because
          she was --too controversial.' "

          "Who?"

          "Eleanor Roosevelt."

          "Oh my God," John laughs, "that must have been wild."

          They want to hear more but it's hard to say anything. Then I
          remember one thing: "In a situation like that a real
          radical's actually got a perfect setup. He can do almost
          anything and get away with it because his opposition have
          already made asses out of themselves. They'll make him look
          good no matter what he says."

          Two kinds of logic are used, inductive and
          deductive. Inductive inferences start with observations of
          the machine and arrive at general conclusions. For example,
          if the cycle goes over a bump and the engine misfires, and
          then goes over another bump and the engine misfires, and
          then goes over another bump and the engine misfires, and
          then goes over a long smooth stretch of road and there is no
          misfiring, and then goes over a fourth bump and the engine
          misfires again, one can logically conclude that the
          misfiring is caused by the bumps. That is induction:
          reasoning from particular experiences to general truths.

          Deductive inferences do the reverse. They start with general
          knowledge and predict a specific observation. For example,
          if, from reading the hierarchy of facts about the machine,
          the mechanic knows the horn of the cycle is powered
          exclusively by electricity from the battery, then he can
          logically infer that if the battery is dead the horn will
          not work. That is deduction.

          Actually I've never seen a cycle-maintenance problem complex
          enough really to require full-scale formal scientific
          method. Repair problems are not that hard. When I think of
          formal scientific method an image sometimes comes to mind of
          an enormous juggernaut, a huge bulldozer...slow, tedious
          lumbering, laborious, but invincible. It takes twice as
          long, five times as long, maybe a dozen times as long as
          informal mechanic's techniques, but you know in the end
          you're going to get it. There's no fault isolation problem
          in motorcycle maintenance that can stand up to it. When
          you've hit a really tough one, tried everything, racked your
          brain and nothing works, and you know that this time Nature
          has really decided to be difficult, you say, "Okay, Nature,
          that's the end of the nice guy," and you crank up the formal
          scientific method.

          For this you keep a lab notebook. Everything gets written
          down, formally, so that you know at all times where you are,
          where you've been, where you're going and where you want to
          get. In scientific work and electronics technology this is
          necessary because otherwise the problems get so complex you
          get lost in them and confused and forget what you know and
          what you don't know and have to give up. In cycle
          maintenance things are not that involved, but when confusion
          starts it's a good idea to hold it down by making everything
          formal and exact. Sometimes just the act of writing down the
          problems straightens out your head as to what they really
          are.

          The logical statements entered into the notebook are broken

          the experiments, (5) observed results of the experiments and
          (6) conclusions from the results of the experiments. This is
          not different from the formal arrangement of many college
          and high-school lab notebooks but the purpose here is no
          longer just busywork. The purpose now is precise guidance of

          The real purpose of scientific method is to make sure Nature
          hasn't misled you into thinking you know something you don't
          actually know. There's not a mechanic or scientist or
          technician alive who hasn't suffered from that one so much
          that he's not instinctively on guard. That's the main reason
          why so much scientific and mechanical information sounds so
          dull and so cautious. If you get careless or go
          romanticizing scientific information, giving it a flourish
          here and there, Nature will soon make a complete fool out of
          you. It does it often enough anyway even when you don't give
          it opportunities. One must be extremely careful and rigidly
          logical when dealing with Nature: one logical slip and an
          entire scientific edifice comes tumbling down. One false
          deduction about the machine and you can get hung up

          In Part One of formal scientific method, which is the
          statement of the problem, the main skill is in stating
          absolutely no more than you are positive you know. It is
          much better to enter a statement "Solve Problem: Why doesn't
          cycle work?" which sounds dumb but is correct, than it is to
          enter a statement "Solve Problem: What is wrong with the
          electrical system?" when you don't absolutely know the
          trouble is in the electrical system. What you should state
          is "Solve Problem: What is wrong with cycle?" and then state
          as the first entry of Part Two: "Hypothesis Number One: The
          trouble is in the electrical system." You think of as many
          hypotheses as you can, then you design experiments to test
          them to see which are true and which are false.

          This careful approach to the beginning questions keeps you
          from taking a major wrong turn which might cause you weeks
          of extra work or can even hang you up completely. Scientific
          questions often have a surface appearance of dumbness for
          this reason. They are asked in order to prevent dumb
          mistakes later on.

          Part Three, that part of formal scientific method called
          experimentation, is sometimes thought of by romantics as all
          of science itself because that's the only part with much
          visual surface. They see lots of test tubes and bizarre
          equipment and people running around making discoveries. They
          do not see the experiment as part of a larger intellectual
          process and so they often confuse experiments with
          demonstrations, which look the same. A man conducting a
          gee-whiz science show with fifty thousand dollars' worth of
          Frankenstein equipment is not doing anything scientific if
          he knows beforehand what the results of his efforts are
          going to be. A motorcycle mechanic, on the other hand, who
          honks the horn to see if the battery works is informally
          conducting a true scientific experiment. He is testing a
          hypothesis by putting the question to nature. The TV
          scientist who mutters sadly, "The experiment is a failure;
          we have failed to achieve what we had hoped for," is
          suffering mainly from a bad scriptwriter. An experiment is
          never a failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted
          results. An experiment is a failure only when it also fails
          adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data
          it produces don't prove anything one way or another.

          Skill at this point consists of using experiments that test
          only the hypothesis in question, nothing less, nothing
          more. If the horn honks, and the mechanic concludes that the
          whole electrical system is working, he is in deep
          trouble. He has reached an illogical conclusion. The honking
          horn only tells him that the battery and horn are
          working. To design an experiment properly he has to think
          very rigidly in terms of what directly causes what. This you
          know from the hierarchy. The horn doesn't make the cycle
          go. Neither does the battery, except in a very indirect
          way. The point at which the electrical system directly
          causes the engine to fire is at the spark plugs, and if you
          don't test here, at the output of the electrical system, you
          will never really know whether the failure is electrical or
          not.

          To test properly the mechanic removes the plug and lays it
          against the engine so that the base around the plug is
          electrically grounded, kicks the starter lever and watches
          the spark plug gap for a blue spark. If there isn't any he
          can conclude one of two things: (a) there is an electrical
          failure or (b) his experiment is sloppy. If he is
          experienced he will try it a few more times, checking
          connections, trying every way he can think of to get that
          plug to fire. Then, if he can't get it to fire, he finally
          concludes that a is correct, there's an electrical failure,
          and the experiment is over. He has proved that his
          hypothesis is correct.

          In the final category, conclusions, skill comes in stating
          no more than the experiment has proved. It hasn't proved
          that when he fixes the electrical system the motorcycle will
          start. There may be other things wrong. But he does know
          that the motorcycle isn't going to run until the electrical
          system is working and he sets up the next formal question:
          "Solve problem: what is wrong with the electrical system?"

          He then sets up hypotheses for these and tests them. By
          asking the right questions and choosing the right tests and
          drawing the right conclusions the mechanic works his way
          down the echelons of the motorcycle hierarchy until he has
          found the exact specific cause or causes of the engine
          failure, and then he changes them so that they no longer
          cause the failure.

          An untrained observer will see only physical labor and often
          get the idea that physical labor is mainly what the mechanic
          does. Actually the physical labor is the smallest and
          easiest part of what the mechanic does. By far the greatest
          part of his work is careful observation and precise
          thinking. That is why mechanics sometimes seem so taciturn
          and withdrawn when performing tests. They don't like it when
          you talk to them because they are concentrating on mental
          images, hierarchies, and not really looking at you or the
          physical motorcycle at all. They are using the experiment as
          part of a program to expand their hierarchy of knowledge of
          the faulty motorcycle and compare it to the correct
          hierarchy in their mind. They are looking at underlying
          form.

          There was a passage he had read and repeated to himself so
          many times it survives intact. It begins:

          "In the temple of science are many mansions--and various
          indeed are they that dwell therein and the motives that have
          led them there.

          Many take to science out of a joyful sense of superior
          intellectual power; science is their own special sport to
          which they look for vivid experience and the satisfaction of
          ambition; many others are to be found in the temple who have
          offered the products of their brains on this altar for
          purely utilitarian purposes. Were an angel of the Lord to
          come and drive all the people belonging to these two
          categories out of the temple, it would be noticeably emptier
          but there would still be some men of both present and past
          times left inside -- . If the types we have just expelled
          were the only types there were, the temple would never have
          existed any more than one can have a wood consisting of
          nothing but creepers--those who have found favor with the
          angel--are somewhat odd, uncommunicative, solitary fellows,
          really less like each other than the hosts of the rejected.

          What has brought them to the temple--no single answer will
          cover--escape from everyday life, with its painful crudity
          and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own
          shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape
          from his noisy cramped surroundings into the silence of the
          high mountains where the eye ranges freely through the still
          pure air and fondly traces out the restful contours
          apparently built for eternity."

          The passage is from a 1918 speech by a young German
          scientist named Albert Einstein.

          The formation of hypotheses is the most mysterious of all
          the categories of scientific method. Where they come from,
          no one knows. A person is sitting somewhere, minding his own
          business, and suddenly...flash!...he understands something
          he didn't understand before. Until it's tested the
          hypothesis isn't truth. For the tests aren't its source. Its

          Einstein had said:

          "Man tries to make for himself in the fashion that suits him
          best a simplified and intelligible picture of the world. He
          then tries to some extent to substitute this cosmos of his
          for the world of experience, and thus to overcome it --. He
          makes this cosmos and its construction the pivot of his
          emotional life in order to find in this way the peace and
          serenity which he cannot find in the narrow whirlpool of
          personal experience --. The supreme task -- is to arrive at
          those universal elementary laws from which the cosmos can be
          built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to
          these laws; only intuition, resting on sympathetic
          understanding of experience, can reach them --"

          Intuition? Sympathy? Strange words for the origin of
          scientific knowledge.

          A lesser scientist than Einstein might have said, "But
          scientific knowledge comes from nature. Nature provides the
          hypotheses." But Einstein understood that nature does
          not. Nature provides only experimental data.

          A lesser mind might then have said, "Well then, man provides
          the hypotheses." But Einstein denied this too. "Nobody," he
          said, "who has really gone into the matter will deny that in
          practice the world of phenomena uniquely determines the
          theoretical system, in spite of the fact that there is no
          theoretical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical
          principles."

          Phædrus' break occurred when, as a result of laboratory
          experience, he became interested in hypotheses as entities
          in themselves. He had noticed again and again in his lab
          work that what might seem

          to be the hardest part of scientific work, thinking up the
          hypotheses, was invariably the easiest. The act of formally
          writing everything down precisely and clearly seemed to
          suggest them. As he was testing hypothesis number one by
          experimental method a flood of other hypotheses would come
          to mind, and as he was testing these, some more came to
          mind, and as he was testing these, still more came to mind
          until it became painfully evident that as he continued
          testing hypotheses and eliminating them or confirming them
          their number did not decrease. It actually increased as he
          went along.

          At first he found it amusing. He coined a law intended to
          have the humor of a Parkinson's law that "The number of
          rational hypotheses that can explain any given phenomenon is
          infinite." It pleased him never to run out of
          hypotheses. Even when his experimental work seemed dead-end
          in every conceivable way, he knew that if he just sat down
          and muddled about it long enough, sure enough, another
          hypothesis would come along. And it always did. It was only
          months after he had coined the law that he began to have
          some doubts about the humor or benefits of it.

          If true, that law is not a minor flaw in scientific
          reasoning. The law is completely nihilistic. It is a
          catastrophic logical disproof of the general validity of all
          scientific method!

          If the purpose of scientific method is to select from among
          a multitude of hypotheses, and if the number of hypotheses
          grows faster than experimental method can handle, then it is
          clear that all hypotheses can never be tested. If all
          hypotheses cannot be tested, then the results of any
          experiment are inconclusive and the entire scientific method
          falls short of its goal of establishing proven knowledge.

          About this Einstein had said, "Evolution has shown that at
          any given moment out of all conceivable constructions a
          single one has always proved itself absolutely superior to
          the rest," and let it go at that. But to Phædrus that was an
          incredibly weak answer. The phrase "at any given moment"
          really shook him. Did Einstein really mean to state that
          truth was a function of time? To state that would annihilate
          the most basic presumption of all science!

          But there it was, the whole history of science, a clear
          story of continuously new and changing explanations of old
          facts. The time spans of permanence seemed completely random
          he could see no order in them. Some scientific truths seemed
          to last for centuries, others for less than a
          year. Scientific truth was not dogma, good for eternity, but
          a temporal quantitative entity that could be studied like
          anything else.

          He studied scientific truths, then became upset even more by
          the apparent cause of their temporal condition. It looked as
          though the time spans of scientific truths are an inverse
          function of the intensity of scientific effort. Thus the
          scientific truths of the twentieth century seem to have a
          much shorter life-span than those of the last century
          because scientific activity is now much greater. If, in the
          next century, scientific activity increases tenfold, then
          the life expectancy of any scientific truth can be expected
          to drop to perhaps one-tenth as long as now. What shortens
          the life-span of the existing truth is the volume of
          hypotheses offered to replace it; the more the hypotheses,
          the shorter the time span of the truth. And what seems to be
          causing the number of hypotheses to grow in recent decades
          seems to be nothing other than scientific method itself. The
          more you look, the more you see. Instead of selecting one
          truth from a multitude you are increasing the
          multitude. What this means logically is that as you try to
          move toward unchanging truth through the application of
          scientific method, you actually do not move toward it at
          all. You move away from it! It is your application of
          scientific method that is causing it to change!

          What Phædrus observed on a personal level was a phenomenon,
          profoundly characteristic of the history of science, which
          has been swept under the carpet for years. The predicted
          results of scientific enquiry and the actual results of
          scientific enquiry are diametrically opposed here, and no
          one seems to pay too much attention to the fact. The purpose
          of scientific method is to select a single truth from among
          many hypothetical truths. That, more than anything else, is
          what science is all about. But historically science has done
          exactly the opposite. Through multiplication upon
          multiplication of facts, information, theories and
          hypotheses, it is science itself that is leading mankind
          from single absolute truths to multiple, indeterminate,
          relative ones. The major producer of the social chaos, the
          indeterminacy of thought and values that rational knowledge
          is supposed to eliminate, is none other than science
          itself. And what Phædrus saw in the isolation of his own
          laboratory work years ago is now seen everywhere in the
          technological world today. Scientifically produced
          antiscience...chaos.

          The cause of our current social crises, he would have said,
          is a genetic defect within the nature of reason itself. And
          until this genetic defect is cleared, the crises will
          continue. Our current modes of rationality are not moving
          society forward into a better world. They are taking it
          further and further from that better world. Since the
          Renaissance these modes have worked. As long as the need for
          food, clothing and shelter is dominant they will continue to
          work. But now that for huge masses of people these needs no
          longer overwhelm everything else, the whole structure of
          reason, handed down to us from ancient times, is no longer
          adequate. It begins to be seen for what it really
          is...emotionally hollow, esthetically meaningless and
          spiritually empty. That, today, is where it is at, and will
          continue to be at for a long time to come.

          No one that Phædrus talked to seemed really concerned about
          this phenomenon that so baffled him. They seemed to say, "We
          know scientific method is valid, so why ask about it?"

          Phædrus didn't understand this attitude, didn't know what to
          do about it, and because he wasn't a student of science for
          personal or utilitarian reasons, it just stopped him
          completely. It was as if he were contemplating that serene
          mountain landscape Einstein had described, and suddenly
          between the mountains had appeared a fissure, a gap of pure
          nothing. And slowly, and agonizingly, to explain this gap,
          he had to admit that the mountains, which had seemed built
          for eternity, might possibly be something else -- perhaps
          just figments of his own imagination.

          expelled from the University for failing grades. Immaturity
          and inattention to studies were given as official causes.

          There was nothing anyone could have done about it; either to
          prevent it or correct it. The University couldn't have kept
          him on without abandoning standards completely.

          He would use this route to get into the high country, then
          backpack in from the road for three or four or five days,
          then come back out for more food and head back in again,
          needing these mountains in an almost physio- logical
          way. The train of his abstractions became so long and so
          involved he had to have the surroundings of silence and
          space here to hold it straight. It was as though hours of
          constructions would have been shattered by the least
          distraction of other thought or other duty. It wasn't like
          other people's thinking, even then, before his insanity. It
          was at a level at which everything shifts and changes, at
          which institutional values and verities are gone and there
          is nothing but one's own spirit to keep one going. His early
          failure had released him from any felt obligation to think
          along institutional lines and his thoughts were already
          independent to a degree few people are familiar with. He
          felt that institutions such as schools, churches,
          governments and political organizations of every sort all
          tended to direct thought for ends other than truth, for the
          perpetuation of their own functions, and for the control of
          individuals in the service of these functions. He came to
          see his early failure as a lucky break, an accidental escape
          from a trap that had been set for him, and he was very
          trap-wary about institutional truths for the remainder of
          his time. He didn't see these things and think this way at
          first, however, only later on. I'm getting way out of
          sequence here. This all came much later.

          At first the truths Phædrus began to pursue were lateral truths; no
          longer the frontal truths of science, those toward which the
          discipline pointed, but the kind of truth you see laterally, out of
          the corner of your eye. In a laboratory situation, when your whole
          procedure goes haywire, when everything goes wrong or is indeterminate
          or is so screwed up by unexpected results you can't make head or tail
          out of anything, you start looking laterally. That's a word he later
          used to describe a growth of knowledge that doesn't move forward like
          an arrow in flight, but expands sideways, like an arrow enlarging in
          flight, or like the archer, discovering that although he has hit the
          bull's eye and won the prize, his head is on a pillow and the sun is
          coming in the window. Lateral knowledge is knowledge that's from a
          wholly unexpected direction, from a direction that's not even
          understood as a direction until the knowledge forces itself upon
          one. Lateral truths point to the falseness of axioms and postulates
          underlying one's existing system of getting at truth.

          just explode with emotion. He writes page after page about
          tiny details of things he sees: marketplaces, shops with
          sliding glass doors, slate roofs, roads, thatched huts,
          everything. Sometimes full of wild enthusiasm, sometimes
          depressed, sometimes angry, sometimes even humorous, he is
          like someone or some creature that has found an exit from a
          cage he did not even know was around him, and is wildly
          roaming over the countryside visually devouring everything
          in sight.

          Later he made friends with Korean laborers who spoke some
          English but wanted to learn more so that they could qualify
          as translators. He spent time with them after working hours
          and in return they took him on long weekend hikes through
          the hills to see their homes and friends and translate for
          him the way of life and thought of another culture.

          He is sitting by a footpath on a beautiful windswept
          hillside overlooking the Yellow Sea. The rice in the terrace
          below the footpath is full-grown and brown. His friends look
          down at the sea with him seeing islands far out from
          shore. They eat a picnic lunch and talk to one another and
          to him and the subject is ideographs and their relation to
          the world. He comments on how amazing it is that everything
          in the universe can be described by the twenty-six written
          characters with which they have been working. His friends
          nod and smile and eat the food they've taken from tins and
          say no pleasantly. He is confused by the nod yes and the
          answer no and so repeats the statement. Again comes the nod
          meaning yes and the answer no. That is the end of the
          fragment, but like the wall it's one he thinks about many
          times.

          This is the foremost compartment of the ship and the canvas
          in the adjoining frames rises and falls, accompanied by
          elevator feelings in his stomach. He contemplates these
          things and a deep booming on the steel plates all around him
          and realizes that except for these signs there is no
          indication whatsoever that this entire compartment is rising
          massively high up into the air and then plunging down, over
          and over again. He wonders if it is that which is making it
          difficult to concentrate on the book before him, but
          realizes that no, the book is just hard. It's a text on
          Oriental philosophy and it's the most difficult book he's
          ever read. He's glad to be alone and bored in this empty
          troop compartment, otherwise he'd never get through it.

          The book states that there's a theoretic component of man's
          existence which is primarily Western (and this corresponded
          to Phædrus' laboratory past) and an esthetic component of
          man's existence which is seen more strongly in the Orient
          (and this corresponded to Phædrus' Korean past) and that
          these never seem to meet. These terms "theoretic" and
          "esthetic" correspond to what Phædrus later called classic
          and romantic modes of reality and probably shaped these
          terms in his mind more than he ever knew. The difference is
          that the classic reality is primarily theoretic but has its
          own esthetics too. The romantic reality is primarily
          esthetic, but has its theory too. The theoretic and esthetic
          split is between components of a single world. The classic
          and romantic split is between two separate worlds. The
          philosophy book, which is called The Meeting of East and
          West, by F. S. C. Northrop, suggests that greater cognizance
          be made of the "undifferentiated aesthetic continuum" from
          which the theoretic arises.

          Phædrus didn't understand this, but after arriving in
          Seattle, and his discharge from the Army, he sat in his
          hotel room for two whole weeks, eating enormous Washington
          apples, and thinking, and eating more apples, and thinking
          some more, and then as a result of all these fragments, and
          thinking, returned to the University to study
          philosophy. His lateral drift was ended. He was actively in
          pursuit of something now.

          I talked about Phædrus' lateral drift, which ended with
          entry into the discipline of philosophy. He saw philosophy
          as the highest echelon of the entire hierarchy of
          knowledge. Among philosophers this is so widely believed
          it's almost a platitude, but for him it's a revelation. He
          discovered that the science he'd once thought of as the
          whole world of knowledge is only a branch of philosophy,
          which is far broader and far more general. The questions he
          had asked about infinite hypotheses hadn't been of interest
          to science because they weren't scientific
          questions. Science cannot study scientific method without
          getting into a bootstrap problem that destroys the validity
          of its answers. The questions he'd asked were at a higher
          level than science goes. And so Phædrus found in philosophy
          a natural continuation of the question that brought him to
          science in the first place, What does it all mean? What's
          the purpose of all this?

          I want to talk about another kind of high country now in the
          world of thought, which in some ways, for me at least, seems
          to parallel or produce feelings similar to this, and call it
          the high country of the mind.

          If all of human knowledge, everything that's known, is
          believed to be an enormous hierarchic structure, then the
          high country of the mind is found at the uppermost reaches
          of this structure in the most general, the most abstract
          considerations of all.

          Few people travel here. There's no real profit to be made
          from wandering through it, yet like this high country of the
          material world all around us, it has its own austere beauty
          that to some people makes the hardships of traveling through
          it seem worthwhile.

          In the high country of the mind one has to become adjusted
          to the thinner air of uncertainty, and to the enormous
          magnitude of questions asked, and to the answers proposed to
          these questions. The sweep goes on and on and on so
          obviously much further than the mind can grasp one hesitates
          even to go near for fear of getting lost in them and never
          finding one's way out.

          It's sometimes argued that there's no real progress; that a
          civilization that kills multitudes in mass warfare, that
          pollutes the land and oceans with ever larger quantities of
          debris, that destroys the dignity of individuals by
          subjecting them to a forced mechanized existence can hardly
          be called an advance over the simpler hunting and gathering
          and agricultural existence of prehistoric times. But this
          argument, though romantically appealing, doesn't hold
          up. The primitive tribes permitted far less individual
          freedom than does modern society. Ancient wars were
          committed with far less moral justification than modern
          ones. A technology that produces debris can find, and is
          finding, ways of disposing of it without ecological
          upset. And the schoolbook pictures of primitive man
          sometimes omit some of the detractions of his primitive
          life...the pain, the disease, famine, the hard labor needed
          just to stay alive. From that agony of bare existence to
          modern life can be soberly described only as upward
          progress, and the sole agent for this progress is quite
          clearly reason itself.

          One can see how both the informal and formal processes of
          hypothesis, experiment, conclusion, century after century,
          repeated with new material, have built up the hierarchies of
          thought which have eliminated most of the enemies of
          primitive man. To some extent the romantic condemnation of
          rationality stems from the very effectiveness of rationality
          in uplifting men from primitive conditions. It's such a
          powerful, all-dominating agent of civilized man it's all but
          shut out everything else and now dominates man
          himself. That's the source of the complaint.
