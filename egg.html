<p class="first">How do you spread the word when a computer has a
security hole? Some say nothing, fearing that telling people how to
mix explosives will encourage them to make bombs. In this book I've
explicitly described some of these security problems, realizing that
people in black hats are already aware of them.</p>

<p>I've tried to reconstruct this incident as I experienced it. My
main sources are my logbooks and diaries, cross-checked by contacting
others involved in this affair and comparing reports from others. A
few people appear under aliases, several phone numbers are changed,
and some conversations have been recounted from memory, but there's no
fictionalizing.</p>

<p>For supporting me throughout the investigation and writing, thanks
to my friends, colleagues, and family. Regina Wiggen has been my
editorial mainstay; thanks also to Jochen Sperber, Jon Rochlis, Dean
Chacon, Winona Smith, Stephan Stoll, Dan Sack, Donald Alvarez, Laurie
McPherson, Rich Muller, Gene Spafford, Andy Goldstein, and Guy
Consolmagno. Thanks also to Bill Stott, for <em>Write to the
Point,</em> a book that changed my way of writing.</p>

<p>I posted a notice to several computer networks, asking for title
suggestions. Several hundred people from around the world replied with
zany ideas. My thanks to Karen Anderson in San Francisco and Nigel
Roberts in Munich for the title and subtitle.</p>

<p>Doubleday's editors, David Gernert and Scott Ferguson, have helped
me throughout. It's been fun to work with the kind people at Pocket
Books, including Bill Grose, Dudley Frasier, and Gertie the Kangaroo,
who's pictured on the cover of this book. To them, as well as my
agent, John Brockman, thanks for your continued encouragement and wise
advice.</p>

<p>To each of these people, I'm indebted; I owe most of them boxes of
cookies as well.</p>

<p>Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory supported me throughout this quest;
the people of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory&#8212;especially
Joe Schwarz and Steve Murray&#8212;have been most gracious and
supportive while I've been writing this book. My deep thanks go to my
friends at both institutes, and my hopes that I'll now be able to
return to astronomy.</p>

<p>I was ten years old when Ernst Both of the Buffalo Museum of
Science invited me to look through a telescope, opening up a universe
of astronomy. I wonder if I'll ever be able to thank him properly.</p>

<p>I needn't thank my sweetheart and wife, Martha Matthews. She's been
as much a part of writing this book as she was in the story.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="first">Me, a wizard? Until a week ago, I was an astronomer,
contentedly designing telescope optics. Looking back on it, I'd lived
in an academic dreamland. All these years, never planning for the
future, right up to the day my grant money ran out.</p>

<p>Lucky for me that my laboratory recycled used astronomers. Instead
of standing in the unemployment line, I found myself transferred from
the Keck Observatory at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, down to the
computer center in the basement of the same building.</p>

<p>Well, hell, I could fake enough computing to impress astronomers,
and maybe pick it up fast enough that my co-workers wouldn't catch
on. Still, a computer wizard? Not me&#8212;I'm an astronomer.</p>

<p>Now what? As I apathetically stared at my computer terminal, I
still thought of planetary orbits and astrophysics. As new kid on the
block, I had my choice of a cubicle with a window facing the Golden
Gate Bridge, or an unventilated office with a wall of
bookshelves. Swallowing my claustrophobia, I picked the office, hoping
that nobody would notice when I slept under the desk. On either side
were offices of two systems people, Wayne Graves and Dave Cleveland,
the old hands of the system. I soon got to know my neighbors through
their bickering.</p>

<p>Viewing everyone as incompetent or lazy, Wayne was crossthreaded
with the rest of the staff. Yet he knew the system thoroughly, from
the disk driver software up to the microwave antennas. Wayne was
weaned on Digital Equipment Corporation's Vax computers and would
tolerate nothing less: not IBM, not Unix, not Macintoshes.</p>

<p>Dave Cleveland, our serene Unix buddha, patiently listened to
Wayne's running stream of computer comparisons. A rare meeting didn't
have Wayne's pitch, "Vaxes are the choice of scientists everywhere and
help build strong programs twelve ways." Dave retorted, "Look, you
keep your Vax addicts happy and I'll handle the rest of the
world."<a id="p1" name="p1"></a></p>

<p>Dave never gave him the satisfaction of getting riled, and Wayne's
complaints eventually trailed off to a mutter.</p>

<p>Great. First day on the job, sandwiched between two characters who
were already ruining my daydreams with their periodic disputes.</p>

<p>At least nobody could complain about my appearance. I wore the
standard Berkeley corporate uniform: grubby shirt, faded jeans, long
hair, and cheap sneakers. Managers occasionally wore ties, but
productivity went down on the days they did.</p>

<p>Together, Wayne, Dave, and I were to run the computers as a
lab-wide utility. We managed a dozen mainframe computers&#8212;giant
workhorses for solving physics problems, together worth around six
million dollars. The scientists using the computers were supposed to
see a simple, powerful computing system, as reliable as the electric
company. This meant keeping the machines running full time, around the
clock. And just like the electric company, we charged for every cycle
of computing that was used.</p>

<p>Of four thousand laboratory employees, perhaps a quarter used the
main computers. Each of these one thousand accounts was tallied daily,
and ledgers kept inside the computer. With an hour of computing
costing three hundred dollars, our bookkeeping had to be accurate, so
we kept track of every page printed, every block of disk space, and
every minute of processor time. A separate computer gathered these
statistics and sent monthly bills to laboratory departments.</p>

<p>And so it happened that on my second day at work, Dave wandered
into my office, mumbling about a hiccup in the Unix accounting
system. Someone must have used a few seconds of computing time without
paying for it. The computer's books didn't quite balance; last month's
bills of $2,387 showed a 75-cent shortfall.</p>

<p>Now, an error of a few thousand dollars is obvious and isn't hard
to find. But errors in the pennies column arise from deeply buried
problems, so finding these bugs is a natural test for a budding
software wizard. Dave said that I ought to think about it.</p>

<p>"First-degree robbery, huh?" I responded.</p>

<p>"Figure it out, Cliff, and you'll amaze everyone," Dave
said.<a id="p2" name="p2"></a>Well, this seemed like a fun toy, so I
dug into the accounting program. I discovered our accounting software
to be a patchwork of programs written by long-departed summer
students. Somehow, the hodgepodge worked well enough to be
ignored. Looking at the mixture of programs, I found the software in
Assembler, Fortran, and Cobol, the most ancient of computer
languages. Might as well have been classical Greek, Latin, and
Sanskrit.</p>

<p>As with most home-brew software, nobody had bothered to document
our accounting system. Only a fool would poke around such a labyrinth
without a map.</p>

<p>Still, here was a plaything for the afternoon and a chance to
explore the system. Dave showed me how the system recorded each time
someone connected to the computer, logging the user's name, and
terminal. It timestamped each connection, recording which tasks the
user executed, how many seconds of processor time he used, and when he
disconnected.</p>

<p>Dave explained that we had two independent accounting systems. The
ordinary Unix accounting software just stored the timestamped records
into a file. But to satisfy some bureaucrat, Dave had built a second
accounting system which kept more detailed records of who was using
the computer.</p>

<p>Over the years, a succession of bored summer students had written
programs to analyze all this accounting information. One program
collected the data and stashed it into a file. A second program read
that file and figured how much to charge for that session. Yet a third
program collected all these charges and printed out bills to be mailed
to each department. The last program added up all user charges and
compared that total to the result from the computer's internal
accounting program. Two accounting files, kept in parallel by
different programs, ought to give the same answer.</p>

<p>For a year, these programs had run without a glitch, but weren't
quite perfect this week. The obvious suspect was round-off
error. Probably each accounting entry was correct, but when added
together, tenths of a penny differences built up until an error of 75
cents accumulated. I ought to be able to prove this either by
analyzing how the programs worked, or by testing them with different
data.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to understand the code for each <a id="p3"
name="p3"></a>program, I wrote a short program to verify the data
files. In a few minutes, I had checked the first program: indeed, it
properly collected the accounting data. No problem with the first.</p>

<p>The second program took me longer to figure out. In an hour I had
slapped together enough makeshift code to prove that it actually
worked. It just added up time intervals, then multiplied by how much
we charge for computer time. So the 75-cent error didn't come from
this program.</p>

<p>And the third program worked perfectly. It looked at a list of
authorized users, found their laboratory accounts, and then printed
out a bill. Round-off error? No, all of the programs kept track of
money down to the hundredths of a penny. Strange. Where's this 75-cent
error coming from?</p>

<p>Well, I'd invested a couple hours in trying to understand a trivial
problem. I got stubborn: dammit, I'd stay there till midnight, if I
had to.</p>

<p>Several test programs later, I began actually to have confidence in
the mishmash of locally built accounting programs. No question that
the accounts didn't balance, but the programs, though not bulletproof,
weren't dropping pennies. By now, I'd found the lists of authorized
users, and figured out how the programs used the data structures to
bill different departments. Around 7 P.M. my eye caught one user,
Hunter. This guy didn't have a valid billing address.</p>

<p>Ha! Hunter used 75 cents of time in the past month, but nobody had
paid for him.</p>

<p>Here's the source of our imbalance. Someone had screwed up when
adding a user to our system. A trivial problem caused by a trivial
error.</p>

<p>Time to celebrate. While writing this first small triumph into the
beginning pages of my notebook, Martha, my sweetheart, stopped by and
we celebrated with late-night cappuccinos at Berkeley's Cafe Roma.</p>

<p>A real wizard would have solved the problem in a few minutes. For
me, it was unknown territory, and finding my way around hadn't been
easy. As a consolation, I'd learned the accounting system and
practiced a couple obsolete languages. Next day, I sent an electronic
mail message to Dave, preening my feathers by pointing out the problem
to him.</p>

<p>Around noon, Dave stopped by to drop off a pile of<a id="p4"
name="p4"></a> manuals, and casually mentioned that he had never added
a user named Hunter&#8212;it must have been one of the other system
managers. Wayne's curt response: "It wasn't me. RTFM." Most of his
sentences ended with acronyms, this one meaning, "Read the fucking
manual."</p>

<p>But I'd read the manuals. Operators weren't supposed to add a new
user without an account. At other computer centers, you just log into
a privileged account and tell the system to add a new user. Since we
also had to make several bookkeeping entries, we couldn't run such a
vanilla system. Ours was complex enough that we had special programs
which automatically did the paperwork and the systems juggling.</p>

<p>Checking around, I found that everyone agreed the automatic system
was so superior that nobody would have manually added a new user. And
the automatic system wouldn't make this mistake.</p>

<p>Well, I couldn't figure out who had made this goof. Nobody knew
Hunter, and there wasn't an account set for him. So I erased the name
from the system&#8212;when he complained, we could set him up
properly.</p>

<p>A day later, an obscure computer named Dockmaster sent us an
electronic mail message. Its system manager claimed that someone from
our laboratory had tried to break into his computer over the
weekend.</p>

<p>Dockmaster's return address might have been anywhere, but signs
pointed to Maryland. The e-mail had passed through a dozen other
computers, and each had left a postmark.</p>

<p>Dave answered the message with a noncommittal "We'll look into it."
Uh, sure. We'd look when all our other problems disappeared.</p>

<p>Our laboratory's computers connect to thousands of other systems
over a dozen networks. Any of our scientists can log into our
computer, and then connect to a distant computer. Once connected, they
can log into the distant computer by entering an account name and
password. In principle, the only thing protecting the networked
computer is the password, since account names are easy to figure
out. (How do you find account names? Just use a phone book&#8212; most
people use their names on computers.)</p>

<p>Dockmaster's electronic mail message was a curiosity,<a id="p5"
name="p5"></a> and Dave passed it to Wayne, attaching a question,
"Who's Dockmaster?" Wayne forwarded it to me with his guess&#8212;
"Probably some bank."</p>

<p>Eventually, Wayne bounced the message to me. I guessed Dockmaster
was some Navy shipyard. It wasn't important, but it seemed worth
spending a few minutes looking into.</p>

<p>The message gave the date and time when someone on our Unix
computer tried to log into Dockmaster's computer. So I scrabbled
around the accounting files, looking at Saturday morning's
records. Again, the two accounting systems disagreed. The stock Unix
accounting file showed a user, Sventek, logging in at 8:25, doing
nothing for half an hour, and then disconnecting. No timestamped
activity in between. Our home-brew software also recorded Sventek's
activity, but it showed him using the networks from 8:31 until 9:01
A.M.</p>

<p>Jeez. Another accounting problem. The time stamps didn't agree. One
showed activity when the other account said everything was
dormant.</p>

<p>Other things seemed more pressing, so I dropped the problem. After
wasting an afternoon chasing after some operator's mistake, I wasn't
about to touch the accounting system again.</p>

<p>Over lunch with Dave, I mentioned that Sventek was the only one
connected when Dockmaster reported the break-in. He stared and said,
"Joe Sventek? He's in Cambridge. Cambridge, England. What's he doing
back?" Turned out that Joe Sventek had been the laboratory's Unix
guru, a software wizard who built a dozen major programs over the past
decade. Joe had left for England a year ago, leaving behind a glowing
reputation throughout the California computer community.</p>

<p>Dave couldn't believe Joe was back in town, since none of Joe's
other friends had heard from him. "He must have entered our computer
from some network," Dave said.</p>

<p>"So you think Joe's responsible for this problem?" I asked
Dave.</p>

<p>"No way," Dave replied. "Joe's a hacker of the old school. A smart,
quick, capable programmer. Not one of those punks that have tarnished
the word 'hacker.' In any<a id="p6" name="p6"></a> case, Sventek
wouldn't try to break into some Maryland computer. And if he did try,
he'd succeed, without leaving any trace."</p>

<p>Curious: Joe Sventek's been in England a year, yet he shows up
early Saturday morning, tries to break into a Maryland computer,
disconnects, and leaves behind an unbalanced accounting system. In the
hallway I mention this to Wayne, who's heard that Joe's on vacation in
England; he's hiding out in the backwoods, far away from any
computers. "Forget that message from Dockmaster. Sventek's due to
visit Berkeley RSN and he'll clear it up."</p>

<p>RSN? Real Soon Now. Wayne's way of saying, "I'm not sure when."</p>

<p>My worry wasn't Sventek. It was the unbalanced accounts. Why were
the two accounting systems keeping different times? And why was some
activity logged in one file without showing up in the other?</p>

<p>Back to the accounting system for an afternoon. I found that the
five-minute time difference between the time stamps came from our
various computers' clocks drifting over the months. One of our
computer's clocks lost a few seconds every day.</p>

<p>But all of Sventek's activities should have appeared in both
tallies. Was this related to last week's accounting problem? Had I
screwed things up when I poked around last week? Or was there some
other explanation?</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p class="first">That afternoon, I sat through an impressively boring
lecture on the structure of galaxies. The learned professor not only
spoke in a monotone, but filled the chalkboard with a snake's nest of
mathematical equations.</p>

<p>Trying to stay awake, I tossed around the problems I'd bumped
into. Someone screwed up when adding a new account. A week later,
Sventek logs in and tries to break into some computer in Maryland. The
accounting record for that event seems garbled. Sventek's
unavailable. Something's <a id="p7" name="p7"></a>amiss. It's almost
as if someone's avoiding the accounting program.</p>

<p>What would it take, I wondered, to use our computers for free?
Could someone have found a way around our accounting system?</p>

<p>Big computers have two types of software: user programs and systems
software. Programs that you write or install yourself are user
programs&#8212;for example, my astronomy routines which analyze a
planet's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Alone, user programs can't do much. They don't talk directly to the
computer; rather, they call upon the operating system to manipulate
the computer. When my astronomy program wants to write something, it
doesn't just slap a word on my screen. Instead, it passes the word to
the operating system, which, in turn, tells the hardware to write a
word.</p>

<p>The operating system, along with the editors, software libraries,
and language interpreters, make up the systems software. You don't
write these programs&#8212;they come with the computer. Once they're
set up, nobody should tamper with them.</p>

<p>The accounting program is systems software. To modify or bypass it,
you have to either be system manager, or somehow have acquired a
privileged position within the operating system.</p>

<p>OK, how do you become privileged? The obvious way is to log onto
our computer with the system manager's password. We hadn't changed our
password in months, but nobody would have leaked it. And an outsider
would never guess our secret password, "wyvern"&#8212;how many people
would think of a mythological winged dragon when guessing our
password?</p>

<p>But even if you became system manager, you wouldn't fool with the
accounting software. It's too obscure, too poorly documented. Anyway,
I'd seen that it worked.</p>

<p>Wait&#8212;our home-brew software worked properly. Someone had
added a new account without using it. Perhaps they didn't know about
it. If someone had come in from the cold, they'd be unaware of our
local wrinkles. Our system managers and operators knew this. Joe
Sventek, even in England, surely would know.<a id="p8" name="p8"></a>
But what about someone from the outside&#8212;a hacker?</p>

<p>The word "hacker" has two very different meanings. The people I
knew who called themselves hackers were software wizards who managed
to creatively program their way out of tight corners. They knew all
the nooks and crannies of the operating system. Not dull software
engineers who put in forty hours a week, but creative programmers who
can't leave the computer until the machine's satisfied. A hacker
identifies with the computer, knowing it like a friend.</p>

<p>Astronomers saw me that way. "Cliff, he's not much of an
astronomer, but what a computer hacker!" (The computer folks, of
course, had a different view: "Cliffs not much of a programmer, but
what an astronomer!" At best, graduate school had taught me to keep
both sides fooled.)</p>

<p>But in common usage, a hacker is someone who breaks into
computers.<a id="ret9" name="ret9" href="#fn9">[*]</a> In 1982, after
a group of students used terminals, modems, and long-distance
telephone lines to break into computers in Los Alamos and the Columbia
Medical Center, the computing people suddenly became aware of the
vulnerability of our networked systems.</p>

<p>Every few months, I'd hear a rumor about someone else's system
being invaded; usually this was at universities, and it was often
blamed on students or teenagers. "Brilliant high school student cracks
into top security computer center." Usually it was harmless and
written off as some hacker's prank.</p>

<p>Could the movie <em>War Games</em> actually happen&#8212;might some
teenage hacker break into a Pentagon computer and start a war?</p>

<p>I doubted it. Sure, it's easy to muck around computers at
universities where no security was needed. After all, colleges seldom
even lock the doors to their buildings. I imagined that military
computers were a whole different story&#8212;they'd be as tightly
secured as a military base. And even if you did<a id="p9"
name="p9"></a> get into a military computer, it's absurd to think you
could start a war. Those things just aren't controlled by computers, I
thought.</p>

<p>Our computers at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory weren't especially
secure, but we were required to keep outsiders away from them and make
an effort to prevent their misuse. We weren't worried about someone
hurting our computers, we just wanted to keep our funding agency, the
Department of Energy, off our backs. If they wanted our computers
painted green, then we'd order paintbrushes.</p>

<p>But to make visiting scientists happy, we had several computer
accounts for guests. With an account name of "guest" and a password of
"guest," anyone could use the system to solve their problems, as long
as they didn't use more than a few dollars of computing time. A hacker
would have an easy time breaking into that account&#8212;it was wide
open. This would hardly be much of a break-in, with time limited to
one minute. But from that account, you could look around the system,
read any public files, and see who was logged in. We felt the minor
security risk was well worth the convenience.</p>

<p>Mulling over the situation, I kept doubting that a hacker was
fooling around in my system. Nobody's interested in particle
physics. Hell, most of our scientists would be delighted if anyone
would read their papers. There's nothing special here to tempt a
hacker&#8212;no snazzy supercomputer, no sexy trade secrets, no
classified data. Indeed, the best part of working at Lawrence Berkeley
Labs was the open, academic atmosphere.</p>

<p>Fifty miles away, Lawrence Livermore Labs did classified work,
developing nuclear bombs and Star Wars projects. Now, that might be a
target for some hacker to break into. But with no connections to the
outside, Livermore's computers can't be dialed into. Their classified
data's protected by brute force: isolation.</p>

<p>If someone did break into our system, what could they accomplish?
They could read any public files. Most of our scientists set their
data this way, so their collaborators can read it. Some of the systems
software was public as well.</p>

<p>Though we call this data public, an outsider shouldn't wander
through it. Some of it's proprietary or copyrighted,<a id="p10"
name="p10"></a> like our software libraries and word processing
programs. Other databases aren't for everyone's
consumption&#8212;lists of our employees' addresses and incomplete
reports on work in progress. Still, these hardly qualify as sensitive
material, and it's a long way from classified.</p>

<p>No, I wasn't worried about someone entering our computer as a guest
and walking off with somebody's telephone number. My real concern
centered on a much bigger problem: could a stranger become a
super-user?</p>

<p>To satisfy a hundred users at once, the computer's operating system
splits the hardware resources much as an apartment house splits a
building into many apartments. Each apartment works independently of
the others. While one resident may be watching TV, another talks on
the phone, and a third washes dishes. Utilities&#8212;electricity,
phone service, and water&#8212;are supplied by the apartment
complex. Every resident complains about slow service and the
exorbitant rents.</p>

<p>Within the computer, one user might be solving a math problem,
another sending electronic mail to Toronto, yet a third writing a
letter. The computer utilities are supplied by the systems software
and operating system; each user grumbles about the unreliable
software, obscure documentation, and the exorbitant costs.</p>

<p>Privacy within the apartment house is regulated by locks and
keys. One resident can't enter another's apartment without a key, and
(if the walls are sturdy), one resident's activity won't bother
another. Within the computer, it's the operating system that ensures
user privacy. You can't get into someone's area without the right
password, and (if the operating system is fair about handing out
resources), one user's programs won't interfere with another's.</p>

<p>But apartment walls are never sturdy enough, and my neighbor's
parties thunder into my bedroom. And my computer still slows down when
there's more than one hundred people using it at one time. So our
apartment houses need superintendents, and our computers need system
managers, or super-users.</p>

<p>With a passkey, the apartment house superintendent can enter any
room. From a privileged account, the system manager can read or modify
any program or data on the<a id="p11"
name="p11"></a>computer. Privileged users bypass the operating system
protections and have the full run of the computer. They need this
power to maintain the systems software ("Fix the editor!"), to tune
the operating system's performance ("Things are too slow today!"), and
to let people use the computer ("Hey, give Barbara an account.").</p>

<p>Privileged users learn to tread lightly. They can't do much damage
if they're only privileged to read files. But the super-user's license
lets you change any part of the system&#8212; there's no protections
against the super-user's mistakes.</p>

<p>Truly, the super-user is all-powerful: she controls the horizontal,
she controls the vertical. When daylight savings time comes around,
she resets the system clock. A new disk drive? She's the only one who
can graft the necessary software into the system. Different operating
systems have various names for privileged accounts&#8212;super-user,
root, system manager&#8212;but these accounts must always be jealously
guarded against outsiders.</p>

<p>What if an outside hacker became privileged on our system? For one
thing, he could add new user accounts.</p>

<p>A hacker with super-user privileges would hold the computer
hostage. With the master key to our system, he could shut it down
whenever he wishes, and could make the system as unreliable as he
wishes. He could read, write, or modify any information in the
computer. No user's file would be protected from him when he operates
from this privileged high ground. The system files, too, would be at
his disposal&#8212;he could read electronic mail before it's
delivered.</p>

<p>He could even modify the accounting files to erase his own
tracks.</p>

<p>The lecturer on galactic structure droned on about gravitational
waves. I was suddenly awake, aware of what was happening in our
computer. I waited around for the question period, asked one token
question, then grabbed my bike and started up the hill to Lawrence
Berkeley Labs.</p>

<p>A super-user hacker. Someone breaks into our system, finds the
master keys, grants himself privileges, and becomes a super-user
hacker. Who? How? From where? And, mostly, why?<a id="p12"
name="p12"></a></p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p class="first">It's only a quarter mile from the University of
California to Lawrence Berkeley Labs, but Cyclotron Road is steep
enough to make it a fifteen-minute bike ride. The old ten-speed didn't
quite have a low enough gear, so my knees felt the last few hundred
feet. Our computer center's nestled between three particle
accelerators: the 184-inch cyclotron, where Ernest Lawrence first
purified a milligram of fissionable uranium; the Bevatron, where the
anti-proton was discovered; and the Hilac, the birthplace of a
half-dozen new elements.</p>

<p>Today, these accelerators are obsolete&#8212;their mega-electron
volt energies long surpassed by giga-electron volt particle
colliders. They're no longer winning Nobel prizes, but physicists and
graduate students still wait six months for time on an accelerator
beamline. After all, our accelerators are fine for studying exotic
nuclear particles and searching out new forms of matter, with esoteric
names like quark-gluon plasmas or pion condensates. And when the
physicists aren't using them, the beams are used for biomedical
research, including cancer therapy.</p>

<p>Back in the heyday of World War II's Manhattan project, Lawrence's
cyclotron was the only way to measure the cross sections of nuclear
reactions and uranium atoms. Naturally, the lab was shrouded in
secrecy; it served as the model for building atomic bomb plants.</p>

<p>During the 1950s, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's research remained
classified, until Edward Teller formed the Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory an hour's drive away. All the classified work went to
Livermore, while the unclassified science remained in Berkeley.</p>

<p>Perhaps to spread confusion, both laboratories are named after
California's first Nobel Laureate, both are centers for atomic
physics, and both are funded by the Atomic Energy Commission's
offspring, the Department of Energy. That's about the end of the
similarity.<a id="p13" name="p13"></a></p>

<p>I needed no security clearance to work in the Berkeley
Lab&#8212;there's no classified research, not a military contract in
sight. Livermore, on the other hand, is a center for designing nuclear
bombs and Star Wars laser beams. Hardly the place for a long-haired
ex-hippie. While my Berkeley Lab survived on meager scientific grants
and unreliable university funding, Livermore constantly expanded. Ever
since Teller designed the H-bomb, Livermore's classified research has
never been short of funds.</p>

<p>Berkeley no longer has huge military contracts, yet openness has
its rewards. As pure scientists, we're encouraged to research any
curious phenomena, and can always publish our results. Our
accelerators might be peashooters compared to the behemoths at CERN in
Switzerland, or Fermilab in Illinois; still, they generate huge
amounts of data, and we run some respectable computers to analyze
it. In fact, it's a source of local pride to find physicists recording
their data at other accelerators, then visiting LBL to analyze their
results on our computers.</p>

<p>In raw number-crunching power, Livermore's computers dwarfed
ours. They regularly bought the biggest, fastest, and most expensive
Grays. They need 'em to figure out what happens in the first few
nanoseconds of a thermonuclear explosion.</p>

<p>Because of their classified research, most of Livermore's computers
are isolated. Of course, they have some unclassified systems too,
doing ordinary science. But for their secret work&#8212;well, it's not
for ordinary mortal eyes. These classified computers have no
connections to the outside world.</p>

<p>It's just as impossible to import data into Livermore from the
outside. Someone designing nuclear bomb triggers using Livermore's
classified computers has to visit the lab in person, bringing his data
in on magnetic tape. He can't use the dozens of networks crossing the
country, and can't log in from home, to see how his program is
running. Since their computers are often the first ones off the
production line, Livermore usually has to write their own operating
systems, forming a bizarre software ecology, unseen outside of their
laboratory. Such are the costs of living in a classified world.</p>

<p>While we didn't have the number-crunching power of<a id="p14"
name="p14"></a> Livermore, our computers were no slouches. Our Vax
computers were speedy, easy to use, and popular among physicists. We
didn't have to invent our own operating systems, since we bought
Digital's VMS operating system, and grabbed Unix from campus. As an
open lab, our computers could be networked anywhere, and we supported
scientists from around the world. When problems developed in the
middle of the night, I just dialed the LBL computer from my
home&#8212;no need to bicycle into work when a phone call might solve
it.</p>

<p>But there I was, bicycling up to work, wondering if some hacker was
in our system. This just might explain some of my accounting
problems. If some outsider had picked the locks on our Unix operating
system and acquired super-user privileges, he'd have the power to
selectively erase the accounting records. And, worse, he could use our
network connections to attack other computers.</p>

<p>I ducked my bike into a corner and jogged over to the cubicle
maze. By now it was well past five, and the ordinary folks were at
home. How could I tell if someone was hacking inside our system? Well,
we could just send an electronic mail message to the suspicious
account, saying something like, "Hey, are you the real Joe Sventek?"
Or we could disable Joe's account, and see if our troubles ended.</p>

<p>My thoughts about the hacker were sidetracked when I found a note
in my office: the astronomy group needed to know how the quality of
the telescope's images degraded if they loosened the specifications
for the mirrors. This meant an evening of model building, all inside
the computer. I wasn't officially working for them anymore, but
blood's thicker than water ... by midnight, I'd plotted the graphs for
them.</p>

<p>The next morning, I eagerly explained my suspicions about a hacker
to Dave Cleveland. "I'll bet you cookies to doughnuts it's a
hacker."</p>

<p>Dave sat back, closed his eyes, and whispered, "Yep, cookies for
sure."</p>

<p>His mental acrobatics were almost palpable. Dave managed his Unix
system with a laid-back style. Since he competed for scientists with
the VMS systems, he had never screwed down the security bolts on his
system, figuring that<a id="p15" name="p15"></a> the physicists would
object and take their business elsewhere. By trusting his users, he
ran an open system and devoted his time to improving their software,
instead of building locks.</p>

<p>Was someone betraying his trust?</p>

<p>Marv Atchley was my new boss. Quiet and sensitive, Marv ran a loose
group that somehow managed to keep the computers running. Marv stood
in contrast to our division head, Roy Kerth. At fifty-five, Roy looked
like Rodney Danger-field as a college professor. He did physics in the
grand style of Lawrence Laboratory, bouncing protons and anti-protons
together, looking at the jetsam from these collisions.</p>

<p>Roy treated his students and staff much as his subatomic particles:
keep them in line, energize them, then shoot them into immovable
objects. His research demanded heavy number crunching, since his lab
generated millions of events each time the accelerator was turned
on. Years of delays and excuses had soured him on computer
professionals, so when I knocked on his door, I made sure we talked
about relativistic physics and ignored computing.</p>

<p>Now, Dave and I could guess Roy's reaction to our problem: "Why the
hell did you leave our doors wide open?"</p>

<p>Our boss's reaction might be predictable, but how should we react?
Dave's first thought was to disable the suspect account and forget
about it. I felt we ought to send a nasty-gram to whoever was breaking
in, telling him to stay away or we'd call his parents. After all, if
someone was breaking in, it was bound to be some student from down on
campus.</p>

<p>But we weren't certain that someone was breaking into our
system. It might explain some of our accounting problems&#8212;someone
learns the system manager's password, connects to our machine, creates
a new account, and tampers with the accounting system. But why would
someone use a new account if they already had access to the system
manager account?</p>

<p>Our boss never wanted to hear bad news, but we swallowed hard and
called a lunchtime meeting. We had no clear proof of a hacker, just
circumstantial pointers, extrapolated from trivial accounting
errors. If there was a break-in, we didn't know how far it extended,
nor who was doing it. Roy Kerth blasted us. "Why are you wasting my
time?<a id="p16" name="p16"></a> You don't know anything and you
haven't proven a whit. Go back and find out. Show me proof."</p>

<p>So how do you find a hacker? I figured it was simple: just watch
for anyone using Sventek's accounts, and try to trace their
connection.</p>

<p>I spent Thursday watching people log into the computer. I wrote a
program to beep my terminal whenever someone connected to the Unix
computer. I couldn't see what each user was doing, but I could see
their names. Every couple minutes my terminal beeped, and I'd see who
had logged in. A few were friends, astronomers working on research
papers or graduate students plugging away on dissertations. Most
accounts belonged to strangers, and I wondered how I could tell which
connection might be a hacker.</p>

<p>At 12:33 on Thursday afternoon, Sventek logged in. I felt a rush of
adrenaline and then a complete letdown when he disappeared within a
minute. Where was he? The only pointer left for me was the identifier
of his terminal: he had used terminal port tt23.</p>

<p>Sitting behind a computer terminal, fingers resting on his
keyboard, someone was connecting into our lab. My Unix computer gave
him the address of port tt23.</p>

<p>Well, that's a start. My problem was to figure out which physical
wires corresponded to the logical name tt23.</p>

<p>Terminals from our laboratory and modems from dial-in telephones
are all assigned "tt" labels, while network connections show up as
"nt." I figured that the guy must be either from our laboratory or
dialing in on a phone line over a modem.</p>

<p>For a few seconds, I'd sensed a hesitant feeler into our
computer. Theoretically, it must be possible to trace the path from
computer to human. Someone must be at the far end of that
connection.</p>

<p>It would take six months to track that path, but my first step was
to trace the connection out of the building. I suspected a dial-in
modem, connected from some telephone line, but it conceivably might be
someone at the laboratory. Over the years, well over five hundred
terminals had been wired in, and only Paul Murray kept track. With
luck, our homegrown hardware connections were documented better than
the home-brew accounting software.</p>

<p><a id="p17" name="p17"></a> Paul's a reclusive hardware technician
who hides in thickets of telephone wire. I found him behind a panel of
electronics, connecting some particle detector to the lab-wide
ethernet system. Ethernets are electronic pipelines connecting
hundreds of small computers. A few miles of orange ethernet cable
snaked through our lab, and Paul knew every inch of it.</p>

<p>Cursing me for surprising him in the middle of soldering a wire, he
refused to give me any help until I proved that I had a legitimate
need to know. Aw, hell. Hardware technicians don't understand software
problems, and software jockeys know nothing about hardware.</p>

<p>Years of ham radio had taught me to solder, so Paul and I had at
least one common denominator. I picked up his spare soldering iron and
earned his grudging respect after a few minutes of burning my fingers
and squinting. Finally, he disentangled himself from the ethernet
cables and showed me around the LBL communications switchyard.</p>

<p>In this roomful of wires, the telephones, intercoms, radios, and
computers were all interconnected by a tangle of cables, wires,
optical fibers, and patch panels. The suspicious port tt23 entered
this room and a secondary computer switched it to one of a thousand
possible terminals. Anyone dialing into the lab would be randomly
assigned to a Unix port. The next time I saw a suspicious character,
I'd have to run .over to the switchyard and unwind the connection by
probing the switching computer. If he disappeared before I
disentangled the connection, well, tough. And even if I did succeed,
I'd only be able to point to a pair of wires entering the
laboratory. I'd still be a long way from the hacker.</p>

<p>By lucky accident, though, the noontime connection had left some
footprints behind. Paul had been collecting statistics on how many
people used the switchyard. By chance he had recorded the port numbers
of each connection for the past month. Since I knew the time when
Sventek was active on port tt23, we could figure out where he came
from. The printout of the statistics showed a one-minute 1200-baud
connection had taken place at 12:33.</p>

<p>1200 baud, huh? That says something. The baud rate measures the
speed that data flows through a line. And 1200 baud means 120
characters per second&#8212;a few pages of text every
minute.<a id="p18" name="p18"></a> Dial-up modems over telephone lines
run at 1200 baud. Any lab employee here on the hill would run at high
speed: 9600 or 19,200 baud. Only someone calling through a modem would
let their data dribble out a 1200-baud soda straw. And the anonymity
and convenience of these dial-in lines are most inviting to
strangers. So pieces were beginning to fit together. I couldn't prove
that we had a hacker in the system, but someone dialed into our lab
and used Sventek's account.</p>

<p>Still, the 1200-baud connection was hardly proof that a hacker
entered our system. An incomplete trace, especially one that went no
farther than my building, would never convince my boss that something
was up, something weird. I needed to find incontrovertible evidence of
a hacker. But how?</p>

<p>Roy Keith had shown me the high-energy particle detectors attached
to the Bevatron: they find jillions of subatomic interactions, and
99.99 percent are explainable by the laws of physics. Spending your
time exploring each particle trail will lead you to conclude that all
the particles obey known physics, and there's nothing left to
discover. Alternatively, you could throw away all the explainable
interactions, and only worry about those that don't quite satisfy the
canonical rules.</p>

<p>Astronomers, distant cousins of high-energy physicists, work along
similar lines. Most stars are boring. Advances come from studying the
weirdies&#8212;the quasars, the pulsars, the gravitational
lenses&#8212;that don't seem to fit into the models that you've grown
up with. Knowing cratering statistics on the planet Mercury tells you
how often the planet was bombarded in the early solar system. But
study the few craters intersected by scarps and ridges and you'll
learn how the planet shrank as it cooled during its first billion
years. Collect raw data and throw away the expected. What remains
challenges your theories.</p>

<p>Well, let's apply this way of thinking to watching someone visiting
my computer. I've got a terminal on my desk, and can borrow a couple
others. Suppose I just watched the traffic coming into the computer
center. There's about five hundred lines entering the system. Most of
these lines run at 9600 baud, or around one hundred fifty words per
second. If half the lines are used at any time, I'd have to
read <a id="p19" name="p19"></a> well over ten thousand pages every
minute. Right. No way could I monitor that kind of traffic on my
terminal.</p>

<p>But the high-speed lines come from people at LBL. We'd already
traced one suspicious connection to a 1200-baud line. There are fewer
of them (we can't afford too many incoming phone lines), and they're
slower. Fifty lines at 1200 baud might generate a hundred pages a
minute, still far too fast to watch on the screen of my terminal. I
might not be able to watch fifty people running at once, but maybe I
could print out all their interactive sessions, and read the piles of
paper at my leisure. A paper printout would provide hard proof of
someone messing around; if we found nothing suspicious, we could drop
the whole project.</p>

<p>I'd record everything that happened during each 1200-baud
connection. This would be technically challenging&#8212;since I didn't
know which line the hacker was calling, I'd have to monitor four
dozen. More worrisome was the ethical problem of monitoring our
communications. Did we have the right to watch the traffic running
through our lines?</p>

<p>My sweetheart, Martha, was just finishing law school. Over a
deep-dish <em>pizza,</em> we talked about the implications of someone
breaking into a computer. I wondered how much trouble I'd be in by
listening to incoming traffic.</p>

<p>"Look," she mumbled, burning the roof of her mouth on the
vulcanized mozzarella. "You're not the government, so you don't need a
search warrant. The worst it would be is invasion of privacy. And
people dialing up a computer probably have no right to insist that the
system's owner not look over their shoulder. So I don't see why you
can't."</p>

<p>So with a clear conscience, I started building a monitoring
system. We had fifty 1200-baud lines, and a hacker might be using any
of them. I had no equipment designed to record the traffic.</p>

<p>But there's an easy way to record a hacker's activity. Modify the
Unix operating system so that whenever a suspicious person logged in,
the system records all the keystrokes. This was tempting because I
only had to add some lines of code to the Unix daemon software.</p>

<p>The daemons themselves are just programs that copy data from the
outside world into the operating system&#8212;the eyes and ears of
Unix. (The ancient Greek daemons were<a id="p20" name="p20"></a>
inferior divinities, midway between gods and men. In that sense, my
daemons are midway between the god-like operating system and the world
of terminals and disks.)</p>

<p>I could split the daemon's output like a T-joint in a pipe, so the
hacker's keystrokes would simultaneously go to both the operating
system and a printer. Software solutions are simple and elegant.</p>

<p>"Muck with the daemons at your own risk," Dave Cleveland
said. "Just respect their timing needs."</p>

<p>Wayne also warned me, "Look, if you goof up, you'll break the
system for sure. It will turn the system into molasses, and there's no
way you'll follow everything that happens. Just wait till you see the
system console print out 'Panic kernel mode interrupt'&#8212;don't
come crying on my shoulder!"</p>

<p>Dave chipped in, "Hey, if your hacker has any Unix experience, he's
bound to notice a change in the daemons."</p>

<p>That convinced me. A sharp systems person would notice that we'd
changed the operating system. The moment the hacker knew someone was
watching him, he'd trash our databases and scram. Our wiretaps had to
be completely undetectable, even to an omnipotent super-user. Silent,
invisible monitors to trap the hacker's activity.</p>

<p>Maybe just tape recording the telephone lines would work, but tape
recorders didn't feel right, too much of a kludge. We'd have to play
them back, and couldn't watch the keystrokes until long after a hacker
had disconnected. Finally, where would I find fifty tape
recorders?</p>

<p>About the only other place to watch our traffic was in between the
modems and the computers. The modems converted the tones of a
telephone into electronic pulses, palatable to our computers and the
daemons in their operating systems. These modem lines appeared as
flat, twenty-five conductor wires, snaking underneath the switchyard's
false floor. A printer or personal computer could be wired to each of
these lines, recording every keystroke that came through.</p>

<p>A kludge? Yes. Workable? Maybe.</p>

<p>All we'd need are fifty teletypes, printers, and portable
computers. The first few were easy to get&#8212;just ask at the lab's
supplies desk. Dave, Wayne, and the rest of the systems group
grudgingly lent their portable terminals. By late <a id="p21"
name="p21"></a> Friday afternoon, we'd hooked up a dozen monitors down
in the switchyard. The other thirty or forty monitors would show up
after the laboratory was deserted. I walked from office to office,
liberating personal computers from secretaries' desks. There'd be hell
to pay on Monday, but it's easier to give an apology than get
permission.</p>

<p>Strewn with four dozen obsolete teletypes and portable terminals,
the floor looked like a computer engineer's nightmare. I slept in the
middle, nursing the printers and computers. Each was grabbing data
from a different line, and whenever someone dialed our system, I'd
wake up to the chatter of typing. Every half hour, one of the monitors
would run out of paper or disk space, so I'd have to roll over and
reload.</p>

<p>Saturday morning, Roy Keith shook me awake. "Well, where's your
hacker?"</p>

<p>Still in my sleeping bag, I must have smelled like a goat. I
blinked stupidly and mumbled something about looking at the fifty
piles of paper.</p>

<p>He snorted, "Well, before you start poking around those printouts,
return those printers. You've been running around here like a maniac
swiping equipment used by people who are getting work done. You've
pissed off a dozen astronomers. Are <em>you</em> getting work done?
No. Whaddya think this place is, your own personal sandbox?"</p>

<p>Bleary-eyed, I dragged each printer back to its rightful owner. The
first forty-nine showed nothing interesting. From the fiftieth trailed
eighty feet of printout. During the night, someone had sneaked in
through a hole in the operating system.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p class="first">For three hours, a hacker had strolled through my
system, reading whatever he wished. Unknown to him, my 1200-baud
Decwriter had saved his session on eighty feet of single-spaced
computer paper. Here was every command he issued, every typing
mistake, and every response from the computer.<a id="p22"
name="p22"></a> This printer monitored the line from Tymnet. I didn't
realize it, but a few of our 1200-baud lines weren't dial-in modem
lines. Rather, they came from Tymnet, a communications company that
interconnected computers around the world.</p>

<p>Before divestment, the Bell system monopolized
communications. AT&amp;T was the only way to connect New York to
Chicago. By using modems, the phone system could handle data, but the
noise and expense of the long-distance service made it unsuitable for
computers. By the late '70s, a few other companies dipped their toes
in the water, offering specialized services like data phones. Tymnet
created a network to interconnect computers in major cities.</p>

<p>Tymnet's idea was simple and elegant: create a digital
communications backbone, let anyone connect to the backbone by making
a local telephone call, then send the data to any computer on the
network. Tymnet would compress dozens of users' data into a few
packets, and economically send these around the country. The system
was immune to noise, and each user could run as fast as he
wished. Customers saved money because they could access a distant
computer by making a local call.</p>

<p>To satisfy scientists around the country, LBL subscribed to
Tymnet. When a researcher in Stonybrook, New York, wanted to connect
to our computer, he dialed his local Tymnet number. Once his modem was
connected to Tymnet, he just asked for LBL and worked as if he were in
Berkeley. Physicists from far away loved the service, and we were
delighted to find them spending their research dollars on our
computers, rather than their home machines.</p>

<p>Someone was breaking in, using the Tymnet line. Since Tymnet
interconnected the whole country, our hacker might be anywhere.</p>

<p>For the moment, though, I was fascinated not by where the hacker
came from, but what he had done in three hours. My guess was right:
Sventek's account was being used to break into our Unix computer.</p>

<p>Not just break in. This hacker was a super-user.</p>

<p>The hacker had sneaked through a hole in our system to become a
super-user&#8212;he'd never even logged into the system manager's
account. He was like a cuckoo bird.</p>

<p><a id="p23" name="p23"></a> The cuckoo lays her eggs in other
birds' nests. She is a nesting parasite: some other bird will raise
her young cuckoos. The survival of cuckoo chicks depends on the
ignorance of other species.</p>

<p>Our mysterious visitor laid an egg-program into our computer,
letting the system hatch it and feed it privileges.</p>

<p>That morning, the hacker wrote a short program to grab
privileges. Normally, Unix won't allow such a program to run, since it
never gives privileges beyond what a user is assigned. But run this
program from a privileged account, and he'll become privileged. His
problem was to masquerade this special program&#8212;the cuckoo's
egg&#8212;so that it would be hatched by the system.</p>

<p>Every five minutes, the Unix system executes its own program
named <em>atrun.</em> In turn, atrun schedules other jobs and does
routine housecleaning tasks. It runs in a privileged mode, with the
full power and trust of the operating system behind it. Were a bogus
atrun program substituted, it would be executed within five minutes,
with full system privileges. For this reason, atrun sits in a
protected area of the system, available only to the system
manager. Nobody but the system manager has the license to tamper with
atrun.</p>

<p>Here was the Cuckoo's nest: for five minutes, he would swap his egg
for the system's atrun program.</p>

<p>For this attack, he needed to find a way to move his egg-program
into the protected systems nest. The operating system's barriers are
built specifically to prevent this. Normal copy programs can't bypass
them; you can't issue a command to "copy my program into systems
space."</p>

<p>But there was a wildcard that we'd never noticed. Richard Stallman,
a free-lance computer programmer, loudly proclaimed that information
should be free. His software, which he gives away for free, is
brilliantly conceived, elegantly written, and addictive.</p>

<p>Over the past decade Stallman created a powerful editing program
called Gnu-Emacs. But Gnu's much more than just a text editor. It's
easy to customize to your personal preferences. It's a foundation upon
which other programs can be built. It even has its own mail facility
built in. Naturally, our physicists demanded Gnu; with an eye to
selling more computing cycles, we installed it happily.<a id="p24"
name="p24"></a></p>

<p>Just one problem: there's a bug in that software.</p>

<p>In the way it was installed on our Unix computer, the Gnu-Emacs
editor lets you forward a mail file from your own directory to anyone
else in an unusual way. It doesn't check to see who's receiving it, or
even whether they want the file. It just renames the file and changes
its ownership label. You've just transferred ownership of the file
from you to me.</p>

<p>No problem to send a file from your area to mine. But you'd better
not be able to move a file into the protected systems area: only the
system manager is allowed there. Stallman's software had better make
sure this can't happen.</p>

<p>Gnu didn't check. It let anyone move a file into protected systems
space. The hacker knew this; we didn't.</p>

<p>The hacker used Gnu to swap his special <em>atrun</em> file for the
system's legitimate version. Five minutes later, the system hatched
his egg, and he held the keys to my computer.</p>

<p>He had used this technique to fool the computer into giving him
power. He planted his phony program where the system expected to find
a valid one. The instant that Unix executed his bogus <em>atrun</em>
program, he became super-user. The whole operation depended on his
being able to move a file anywhere he wished.</p>

<p>Gnu was the hole in our system's security. A subtle bug in an
obscure section of some popular software. Installed blindly by our
systems programmers, we'd never thought that it might destroy our
whole system's security.</p>

<p>Now I understood. Our friend must have entered a guest account,
leveraged his privileges using Gnu's hole, and then added a new
account to the computer's files.</p>

<p>In front of me, the first few feet of the printout showed the
cuckoo preparing the nest, laying the egg, and waiting for it to
hatch. The next seventy feet showed the fledgling cuckoo testing its
wings.</p>

<p>As super-user, he had the run of our system. First thing he did was
erase his tracks: he switched the good copy of <em>atrun</em> back
where it belonged. Then he listed the electronic mail of all our
users, reading news, gossip, and love letters. He learned of the past
month's computer changes, grant proposals, and new hires. He searched
for changes in the system managers' files, and discovered that I'd
just started<a id="p25" name="p25"></a> work. He checked my salary and
resumed More worrisome, he realized that I was a system manager, and
my account name.</p>

<p>Why me? What did I do? At any rate, from now on, I'd better use a
different name.</p>

<p>Every ten minutes, the hacker issued the command, "who," to list
everyone logged onto the computer. Apparently, he worried that someone
might see him connected, or might be watching. Later, he searched for
any changes in the operating system&#8212;had I modified the daemons
to record his session, as I'd first planned to do, he would surely
have discovered it. I felt like a kid playing hide-and-seek, when the
seeker passes within inches of his hiding place.</p>

<p>Within the first hour, he wrote a program to scan everyone's mail
messages for any mention of his activity. He searched for the word,
"hacker," and "security."</p>

<p>One scientist had started a program that assembled data from an
experiment over the weekend. Running under the name "gather," this
program innocuously collected information every few minutes and wrote
it to a file. The hacker saw this program, spent ten minutes trying to
understand what it did, and killed it.</p>

<p>Yow! Here's someone looking over his shoulder every few minutes,
checking to see if anyone's around. He kills any jobs that he thinks
might monitor him. He opens my mail, checking to see if anyone's
written about hackers. Wayne was right: if you stay in the open, he'll
know you're watching. From now on, we'd have to be subtle and
invisible.</p>

<p>When he wasn't looking back over his shoulder, the hacker was
reading files. By studying several scientists' command files and
scripts, he discovered pathways into other lab computers. Every night,
our computer automatically calls twenty others, to exchange mail and
network news. When the hacker read these phone numbers, he learned
twenty new targets.</p>

<p>From the mail file of an engineer:</p>

<pre>
"Hi, Ed!

I'll be on vacation for the next couple weeks.  If you need to get any
of my data, just log into my account on the Vax computer.  Account
name Is Wilson, password Is Maryanne (that's my wife's name). Have
fun!"

</pre>

<a id="p26" name="p26"></a>

<p>The hacker had fun, even if Ed didn't. He connected through our
local area network into that Vax, and had no problem logging into
Wilson's account. Wilson wouldn't notice the hacker reading his files,
and probably wouldn't care. They contained numerical data, meaningless
to anyone but another nuclear physicist.</p>

<p>Our visitor knew about our lab's internal networks. Our dozen big
computers were tied to a hundred laboratory computers using ethernets,
serial lines, and chewing gum. When physicists wanted to get data from
a computer at the cyclotron into our big computer, elegance meant
nothing. They'd use any port, any line, any network. Over the years
technicians had woven a web of cables around the lab, interconnecting
most of the computers with whatever seemed to work. This local area
network reached into every office, connecting PC's, Macintoshes, and
terminals to our mainframe computers.</p>

<p>Often, these networked computers had been arranged to trust each
other. If you're OK on that computer, then you're OK on this one. This
saved a bit of time: people wouldn't need to present more than one
password when using several computers.</p>

<p>The hacker exploited that trust to enter a half dozen computers. As
super-user on our main Unix computer, he disguised himself under
someone else's account name. Then he just knocked on the door of
another networked machine, and he was admitted without even whispering
the password. Our visitor couldn't know what these systems were used
for; still, he felt his way around the net, searching for connections
into unexplored computers.</p>

<p>By the end of the session, the printer's ribbon had run out of
ink. By rubbing a pencil lightly over the paper, I could just make out
the impressions left from the printhead: the hacker had copied our
password file, then disconnected.</p>

<p>A bass guitar note took my attention from the hacker's trail. The
Grateful Dead were playing outdoors at the Berkeley Greek Theater,
only a hundred yards downhill from the lab. The police couldn't keep
people from sitting in the field overlooking the concert, so I skipped
over there, mingling with a thousand others in tie-dyed
shirts. Burnt-out panhandlers, left over from the sixties, worked the
crowd, begging <a id="p27" name="p27"></a> tickets and selling
posters, buttons, and grass. The drum solo in the second set echoed
from Strawberry Canyon, adding a weird backbeat appreciated only by us
cheapskates in the fields. Life was full: no hacker is worth missing a
Dead concert for.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p class="first">Monday morning marked my second week on the job. I
was an uneasy computer jockey: surrounded by overworked experts, yet
not knowing what tasks I ought to be doing. Something fun would turn
up; in the meantime, I might as well finish this hacker project.</p>

<p>Like a freshman in physics lab, I wrote about the weekend's
activity in a logbook. Not that I planned to use this logbook: it was
a chance to learn a word processor on my Macintosh. The astronomer's
rule of thumb: if you don't write it down, it didn't happen.</p>

<p>I passed the results to the gang, hoping nobody would notice that
I'd slept overnight in the machine room.</p>

<p>The boss wanted to see me as soon as he arrived.</p>

<p>I suspected he was mad about my grabbing all those
terminals. Management might be loose, but computer jocks still weren't
supposed to borrow piles of lab equipment without telling anyone.</p>

<p>But Roy didn't even grinch about the terminals. He wanted to know
about the hacker.</p>

<p>"When did he show up?"</p>

<p>"Sunday morning at five for three hours."</p>

<p>"Delete any files?"</p>

<p>"Killed one program that he thought was monitoring him."</p>

<p>"Are we in danger?"</p>

<p>"He's super-user. He can wipe out all our files."</p>

<p>"Can we shut him down?"</p>

<p>"Probably. We know the one hole; it's a quick patch."</p>

<p>"Think that'll stop him?"</p>

<p>I could sense where his thoughts were leading. Roy wasn't concerned
about slamming the door. He knew we could<a id="p28" name="p28"></a>
easily deactivate the stolen Sventek account. And now that we
understood it, fixing the Gnu-Emacs hole wasn't difficult: just add a
couple lines of code to check the target directory.</p>

<p>Should we close our doors or remain open? Closing up shop was the
obvious reaction. We knew how this hacker entered our system and knew
how to kick him out.</p>

<p>But what else was wrong? What other gifts had our mysterious
visitor left for us? How many other accounts did he access? What other
computers did he break into?</p>

<p>There was the worry. The printout showed the hacker to be a
competent systems programmer, able to exploit obscure bugs that we'd
never seen before. What else had he done?</p>

<p>When you're super-user, you can modify any file in the system. Did
the hacker modify a system program to open a backdoor entrance? Had he
patched our system to recognize a magic password?</p>

<p>Did he plant a computer virus? On home computers, viruses spread by
copying themselves into other pieces of software. When you give an
infected piece of software to someone else, the virus copies itself
into other software, spreading from disk to disk.</p>

<p>If the virus is benign, it'll be hard to detect and probably won't
do much damage. But it's easy to build malicious viruses which
duplicate themselves and then erase data files. Just as easy to create
a virus that lies dormant for months and then erupts some day in the
future.</p>

<p>Viruses are the creatures that haunt programmers' nightmares.</p>

<p>As super-user, the hacker could infect our system in a way that
would be almost impossible to eradicate. His virus could copy itself
into systems software and hide in obscure areas of the computer. By
copying itself from program to program, it would defy our efforts to
erase it.</p>

<p>Unlike a home computer, where you can rebuild the operating system
from scratch, we had extensively modified our operating system. We
couldn't go to a manufacturer and say, "Give us an original copy."
Once infected, we could only rebuild our system from backup tapes. If
he'd planted a -virus six months ago, our tapes would be infected as
well.</p>

<p><a id="p29" name="p29"></a> Maybe he'd planted a logic bomb&#8212;a
program timed to blow up sometime in the future. Or perhaps this
intruder had only rifled our files, killed a couple jobs, and screwed
up our accounting. But how could we tell that he hadn't done much
worse? For a week, our computer was wide open to this hacker. Could we
prove that he hadn't tampered with our databases?</p>

<p>How could we again trust our programs and data?</p>

<p>We couldn't. Trying to shut him out wouldn't work, as he'd only
find another way in. We needed to find out what he had done and what
he was doing.</p>

<p>Most of all, we needed to know who was at the other end of the
line.</p>

<p>"It's gotta be some student on the Berkeley campus," I said to
Roy. "They're the Unix wizards, and they think of us as bozos."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be too sure." Roy leaned back in his chair. "Why would
someone from Berkeley come in through Tymnet, when they could more
easily have dialed our system over the telephone lines?"</p>

<p>"Maybe Tymnet is just a cover," I said. "A place to hide. If he
dialed the lab directly, we'd trace him. But now, we've got to trace
both Tymnet and a telephone call."</p>

<p>My hand waving didn't convince the boss. Perhaps from his
scientific experience or maybe as a cynical ploy, Roy kept an open
mind: it's not a student until he's dragged in. Sure, the weekend's
printouts showed a good programmer, but we might be watching any
competent computer jockey, anywhere. Tracking the guy meant tracing
telephone lines. The price of hard evidence was hard work.</p>

<p>Confronted with traces of a mysterious visitor, Roy only saw
footprints. I saw an intruder.</p>

<p>Roy decided not to decide. "Let's close down all network
connections for the day. Tomorrow morning, I'll talk to the lab
director, and get a sense of what to do." We could delay, but sooner
or later we'd have to either start tracing, or lock the guy out.</p>

<p>Did I want to track someone through the city? It would keep me from
scientific computing. It had nothing to do with astronomy or
physics. And it sounded like cops and robbers&#8212;or a game of
hide-and-seek.<a id="p30" name="p30"></a></p>

<p>On the plus side, though, I might learn about phone traces and
networks. Best of all was imagining the look on some kid's face when
we barged into his dorm room, shouting, "Freeze! Drop that
keyboard!"</p>

<p>Tuesday afternoon, Roy called. "The director says, "This is
electronic terrorism. Use all the resources you need to catch the
bastard. Take all the time you want. Spend three weeks, if you have
to. Nail the bastard.' "</p>

<p>If I wanted to hunt the hacker, management backed me.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p class="first">I biked home, thinking of devious hacker-trapping
schemes. As I came closer to home, though, my thoughts turned to
dinner. So great to have someone to come home to.</p>

<p>Martha Matthews and I had lived together for a few years now, and
been friends for almost ten. We'd known each other so well that it was
hard to remember a time before I knew her.</p>

<p>Old friends shook their heads. They'd never seen me stay with one
woman this long. I'd fall in love, hang around for a couple years, and
then we'd grow tired of each other and move on. I was still good
friends with several former lovers, but the romance never seemed to
last. I'd always been cynical and sarcastic, protecting myself from
getting too close to anyone.</p>

<p>But life with Martha felt different. Barrier after barrier came
down, slowly, over time. She insisted on talking out our differences,
demanded to know the reasons for my moods and tempers, demanded that
we think of ways to get along better. It was unbearable
sometimes&#8212;I hated to talk when I was mad&#8212;but it usually
seemed to work.</p>

<p>I found myself feeling nesting instincts. The perfect afternoon was
to tinker around the house, rewiring a switch, planting some bulbs, or
soldering a stained-glass window. We spent many a quiet evening,
sewing or reading or playing scrabble. I began to feel. . .</p>

<p>Married? Who, me? No. Definitely not. Marriage was<a id="p31"
name="p31"></a> stultifying, a trap for the conventional. You married
someone and they expected you to stay the same forever, never
changing, never doing anything new. There'd be fights and you couldn't
leave, you'd get tired of the same person every evening, every
morning. Limiting, dreary, artificial, and conventional.</p>

<p>Living together was different. We were both free. We freely chose
to share each day, and either of us could leave if the relationship
was no longer good for us. It was better this way, and Martha seemed
content.</p>

<p>Uh, right.</p>

<p>I wondered if she'd remain cheerful if I spent the next few weeks
sleeping at work.</p>

<p>Three weeks to catch a hacker. How long should this take? Perhaps a
couple days to set up traces, another few days to track him through
the networks, and then bust him. Probably we'd need the cooperation of
the police, so add a day or two. We could wrap it up in two weeks,
then I'd be back to managing a computer, and maybe a bit of astronomy
on the side.</p>

<p>We needed to weave a net fine enough to catch the hacker, but
coarse enough to let our scientists through. I'd have to detect the
hacker as soon as he came on line and call Tymnet's technicians to
trace the call.</p>

<p>Detecting the hacker was easy: I'd just camp out in my office
alongside two terminals. One terminal for working, another to watch
the system. Each time someone logged onto the computer, two beeps
would tell me to check out the new user. As soon as a stranger showed
up, I'd run down to the switchyard and see what they were doing.</p>

<p>Theoretically foolproof. Impossible in practice. From a thousand
users, I knew about twenty. The other 980? Well, I had to check each
one. So every two minutes I'd jog down the hall, thinking that I'd
caught someone. And since I'd miss the signal if I went home, I
ignored Martha and slept under the desk.</p>

<p>The rug smelled like a seat on a crosstown bus and whenever the
terminal beeped, I'd sit up and gouge my head on the bottom of a
drawer. A couple nights of slicing my forehead convinced me that there
had to be an easier way.</p>

<p>If I knew the stolen account names, it would be easy to<a id="p32"
name="p32"></a> write a program that watched for the bad guy to show
up. No need to check out every person using the computer; just ring a
bell when a stolen account was in use. But I also remembered Wayne
Graves' warning&#8212;stay invisible.</p>

<p>That meant no jobs running on the main computer. But I could watch
from another computer. We'd just installed a new Unix computer, our
Unix-8 system. Nobody had used it yet, so it might not be secure, but
it surely wasn't contaminated. I could connect it to our local area
network, secure it against all possible attacks, and let it watch the
Unix-4 and Unix-5 computers.</p>

<p>I'd protect my Unix-8 castle with a one-way moat. Information could
come into the computer, but nothing could go out. Dave Cleveland,
hardly excited about chasing a hacker, smiled slightly and told me how
to set Unix-8 to reject all log-in attempts, yet covertly scan the
other Unix machines for signs of bad guys.</p>

<p>The program wasn't hard&#8212;just a few dozen lines of code to get
a status block from each of the local computers. From long tradition,
astronomers have programmed in Fortran, so I wasn't surprised when
Dave gave me the hairy eyeball for using such an antiquated
language. He challenged me to use the C language; in a few minutes
he'd reduced it to twenty lines of tightly written code.</p>

<p>We fired up Dave's watchdog program on the Unix-8 computer. From
the outside, it looked like just one more laboratory system. Anyone
inquiring about its status received an invitation to log in. But you
couldn't log on, since that computer rejected everyone except Dave and
me. The hacker shouldn't be suspicious, since that computer didn't
appear to be hooked up.</p>

<p>From this high ground, a network messenger asked each of the other
Unix computers, "Hey, who's logged on?" Each minute, the Unix-8
program analyzed these reports, and searched for Sventek's name. When
Sventek showed up, my terminal beeped, and it was forehead-gouging
tune.</p>

<p>But alarms alone wouldn't catch the hacker. We needed to track him
through our system, and back to his lair. And to protect ourselves, we
had to know what he was doing.</p>

<p>There was no way to grab fifty printers again to monitor all the
traffic through our system, so I had to watch only <a id="p33"
name="p33"></a> those lines that he'd be likely to use. Saturday
morning, he'd entered through one of our four Tymnet connections, so
that seemed like a good place to start.</p>

<p>I couldn't buy, steal, or borrow four printers for a few weeks, so
I went out begging. One physics professor gave me a beat-up old
Decwriter, delighted that someone would take the ten-year-old heap off
his hands. A secretary donated a spare IBM PC in exchange for my
teaching her how to use spreadsheet programs. A combination of
cookies, coaxing, and conniving led to two more obsolete printers. We
were back in business, recording all our Tymnet traffic.</p>

<p>Wednesday afternoon marked a week since we'd first detected the
hacker. Berkeley was sunny, though I could barely see the windows from
across the maze of cubicles. Dave's watchdog was awake, the printers
busy chattering with every keystroke, and I was absentmindedly
thinking of infrared emissions from the Pleiades star
cluster. Suddenly, the terminal beeped twice: Sventek's account was
active. My adrenaline pumped as I ran to the switchyard; the top of
the ream of paper showed the hacker had logged in at 2:26 and was
still active.</p>

<p>Letter by letter, the printer spat out the hacker's keystrokes.</p>

<p>Logged into the Unix-4 computer as Sventek, he first listed the
names of everyone connected. Lucky&#8212;there was nobody but the
usual gang of physicists and astronomers; my watchdog program was well
concealed within the Unix-8 computer. "Looking over your shoulder
again," I thought. "Sorry, nobody here but us astrophysicists," I
whispered to the terminal.</p>

<p>All the same, he scanned all the processes running. The Unix
command <em>ps</em> prints the status of other processes. Habitually,
I usually typed in <em>ps -axu,</em> the last three characters telling
mother Unix to tell everyone's status. The intruder, however,
entered <em>ps -eafg.</em> Strange. I'd never seen anyone use
the <em>g</em> flag. Not that he discovered much: just a few
scientific analysis programs, and a cranky typesetting
program&#8212;and a network link to the Unix-8 system.</p>

<p>It'd taken him just three minutes to discover the Unix-8 computer,
loosely linked to the Unix-4 system. But could he get in? With the
Unix <em>rlogin</em> command he tried a half-dozen times, knocking on
the door of the Unix-8 machine<a id="p34" name="p34"></a> with
Sventek's account name and password. No luck. Dave had nailed that
door closed.</p>

<p>Apparently satisfied that nobody was watching him, he listed the
system password file. There wasn't much for him to see there: all the
passwords are encrypted and then stored. An encrypted password looks
like gibberish; without solving an extremely difficult cipher, the
password file gave the hacker little more than a dream.</p>

<p>He didn't become super-user; rather he checked that the Gnu-Emacs
file hadn't been modified. This ended any doubts about whether the
same hacker was connected: nobody else would search out the security
hole in our system. At 2:37, eleven minutes after he logged in, he
abruptly logged off the Unix-4 computer. But not before we'd started
the trace.</p>

<p>Tymnet! I'd forgotten to warn their network operations center that
they'd have to trace some connections. I hadn't even asked whether
they could trace their own network. Now, watching the printer copy
every key that the hacker pressed, there were only minutes to get the
trace.</p>

<p>Ron Vivier traces Tymnet's network within North America. While I
talked to him on the phone, I could hear him punching keys on his
terminal. In a staccato voice, he asked for our node's address. At
least I'd prepared that much. In a couple minutes, Ron had traced the
connection from LBL's Tymnet port into an Oakland Tymnet office, where
someone had dialed in from a telephone.</p>

<p>According to Ron, the hacker had called Tymnet's modem in Oakland,
just three miles from our lab.</p>

<p>It's easier to call straight into our Berkeley lab than to go
through Oakland's Tymnet office. Why call through Tymnet when you can
dial directly into our system? Calling direct would eliminate Tymnet's
intermediate connections and might be a tad more reliable. But calling
via Tymnet added one more layer to trace.</p>

<p>The hacker had called the local Tymnet access number instead of our
lab. It was like taking the interstate to drive three blocks. Whoever
was at the other end of the line knew how to hide. Ron Vivier gave his
condolences&#8212;I hadn't wanted just some Tymnet telephone number; I
was hunting for a person.</p>

<p>Well, we were on the trail, but there were bends in the <a id="p35"
name="p35"></a> road. Somehow, we'd have to trace the phone call, and
phone traces meant court orders. Phooey.</p>

<p>When the hacker logged off, I looked up from the printout. Like a
firehouse dog, Roy Kerth had picked up the news and made it down to
the switchyard. So had Dave and Wayne.</p>

<p>When Ron hung up, I announced, "He's calling Oakland Tymnet. So he
must be from around here. If he were in Peoria, he'd save his nickel
and call the Peoria Tymnet modem."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're probably right." Roy didn't look forward to losing a
bet.</p>

<p>Dave wasn't thinking about the phone trace. "This <em>ps -eafg</em>
command bothers me," he said. "I can't say why&#8212;it just doesn't
taste right. Maybe it's just paranoia, but I'm sure that I've seen
that combination before."</p>

<p>"To hell with Unix. Serves us right for running such a dog
operating system." Wayne saw a chance to bait Dave. "Hey, that
password file isn't much use to him, is it?"</p>

<p>"Only if he owns a supercomputer. You'd need one to unravel the
encryption. Unix isn't VMS&#8212;it's got the tightest cypher locks
around," Dave countered.</p>

<p>Roy had heard it before; he saw himself as above the war of the
operating systems. "Looks like <em>you</em> need some phone traces,
Cliff."</p>

<p>I didn't like his choice of pronoun, but, yes, that was the
point. "Any ideas on where to start?"</p>

<p>"Let your fingers do the walking."</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p class="first">The morning after we watched the hacker break into
our computer, the boss met with Aletha Owens, the lab's
attorney. Aletha didn't care about computers, but had a wary eye for
problems on the horizon. She wasted no time in calling the FBI.</p>

<p>Our local FBI office didn't raise an eyebrow. Fred Wyniken, special
agent with the Oakland resident agency, asked incredulously, "You're
calling us because you've lost seventy-five cents in computer time?"
Aletha tried<a id="p36" name="p36"></a> explaining information
security, and the value of our data. Wyniken interrupted and said,
"Look, if you can demonstrate a loss of more than a million dollars,
or that someone's prying through classified data, then we'll open an
investigation. Until then, leave us alone."</p>

<p>Right. Depending on how you looked at it, our data was worth either
nothing or zillions of dollars. How much is the structure of an enzyme
worth? What's the value of a high-temperature superconductor? The FBI
thought in terms of bank embezzlement; we lived in a world of
research. Classified data? We weren't a military base or an atomic
weapons lab.</p>

<p>Yet we needed the FBI's cooperation. When the hacker next popped
his periscope above the water, we'd probably track him to the Tymnet's
Oakland telephone access number. From there, I hoped a phone trace
would lead to him. But I'd heard that the phone company wouldn't trace
a line without a search warrant. And we needed the FBI to get that
warrant.</p>

<p>After hitting the FBI's brick wall, Aletha called our local
District Attorney. The Oakland DA didn't fool around: "Someone's
breaking into your computer? Hell, let's get a warrant and trace them
lines." The FBI might not give a damn, but our local prosecutors took
us seriously. Still, they would have to convince a judge. Our warrant
was at least a week away.</p>

<p>Just after five, Dave stopped by and started talking about the
break-in.</p>

<p>"Cliff, the hacker's not from Berkeley."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"You saw that guy typing in the <em>ps -eafg</em> command,
right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, here's the printout," I replied. "It's just an ordinary Unix
command to list all the active processes&#8212;'ps' means print
status, and the four letters modify the display. In a sense, they're
like switches on a stereo&#8212;they change the way the command
works."</p>

<p>"Cliff, I can tell you're used to Berkeley Unix. Ever since
Berkeley Unix was invented, we've mechanically typed 'ps' to see
what's happening on the system. But tell me, what do those four
letters modify?"</p>

<p>Dave knew my ignorance of obscure Unix commands. I put up the best
front I could: "Well, the <em>e</em> flag means list<a id="p37"
name="p37"></a> both the process name and environment, and
the <em>a</em> flag lists everyone's process&#8212;not just your
process. So the hacker wanted to see everything that was running on
the system."</p>

<p>"OK, you got half of 'em. So what are the <em>g</em> and <em>f</em>
flags for?"</p>

<p>"I dunno." Dave let me flounder until I admitted ignorance.</p>

<p>"You ask for a <em>g</em> listing when you want both interesting
and uninteresting processes. All the unimportant jobs, like
accounting, will show up. As will any hidden processes."</p>

<p>"And we know he's diddling with the accounting program."</p>

<p>Dave smiled. "So that leaves us with the <em>f</em> flag. And it's
not in any Berkeley Unix. It's the AT&amp;T Unix way to list each
process's files. Berkeley Unix does this automatically, and doesn't
need the <em>f</em> flag. Our friend doesn't know Berkeley Unix. He's
from the school of old-fashioned Unix."</p>

<p>The Unix operating system was invented in the early 1970s at
AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. In the late '70s, Unix
zealots from Bell Labs visited the Berkeley campus, and a new, richer
version of Unix was developed. Along with hot tubs, leftist politics,
and the free speech movement, Berkeley is known for its Unix
implementation.</p>

<p>A schism developed between advocates of the small, compact AT&amp;T
Unix and the more elaborate Berkeley implementation. Despite
conferences, standards, and promises, no consensus has appeared, and
the world is left with two competing Unix operating systems.</p>

<p>Of course, our lab used Berkeley Unix, as do all right-thinking
folks. East Coast people were said to be biased towards AT&amp;T Unix,
but then, they hadn't discovered hot tubs either.</p>

<p>From a single letter, Dave ruled out the entire computing
population of the West Coast. Conceivably, a Berkeley hacker might use
an old-fashioned command, but Dave discounted this. "We're watching
someone who's never used Berkeley Unix." He sucked in his breath and
whispered, "A heathen."</p>

<p>Wayne didn't give a damn about Unix. As a VMS junkie, Wayne was an
infidel. Moreover, he felt the hacker couldn't learn anything from our
password file: "Look, there's no way that anyone can decrypt those
passwords. About all he's learned is our names. Why
bother?"<a id="p38" name="p38"></a></p>

<p>I'd rolled this around in my mind. Passwords are at the heart of
security on a big computer. Home computers don't need passwords:
there's only one user. Anyone at the keyboard can access any
program. But when there's ten or twenty people using a single system,
the computer must be certain that the person behind the terminal isn't
an imposter.</p>

<p>Like an electronic signature, passwords verify the authenticity of
a transaction. Automatic teller machines, telephone credit cards,
electronic funds transfer networks, even some home telephone-answering
machines depend on passwords. By filching or forging passwords, a
hacker can create counterfeit wealth, steal services, or cover bounced
checks. When money was stored in vaults, safecrackers attacked the
combination locks. Now that securities are just bits in a computer's
memory, thieves go after the passwords.</p>

<p>When your computer has fifty or a hundred users, you might just
store each person's password in a file. When the user tries to log on,
ask for her password and compare that to what's in your file. In a
friendly environment, no problem. But how do you keep someone from
sneaking a peek at that password file? Well, protect the password file
so that only the system can read it.</p>

<p>Even if you protect the password file, every now and then all the
files will be copied onto backup tapes. Even a novice programmer could
read those tapes on another computer and list the contents of the
password file. File protection alone isn't enough.</p>

<p>In 1975, Bob Morris and Fred Grampp of Bell Laboratories developed
a way to protect passwords, even when files weren't secure. They would
rely on encryption, rather than file protection. If you chose the
password "cradle," the computer doesn't simply store your choice into
a file of passwords. Instead, Unix scrambles the letters into an
encrypted word, say, "pn6yywersyq." Your encrypted password is stored,
not the plain text.</p>

<p>So a Unix password file might look something like this:</p>

<pre>
Aaron: fnqs241kcvs Blacker: anvpqwOxcsr Blatz: pn6yywersyq Goldman:
mwe783Jcyl2 Henderson: rp2d9c!49b7
</pre>

<p><a id="p39" name="p39"></a> Following each account name is the
encrypted password. Like Wayne said, stealing the password file just
gives you a list of people.</p>

<p>The computer program that encrypts "cradle" into "pn6yywersyq" is
built upon a trapdoor algorithm: a process that's easy to do, but
difficult to undo. When Sally Blatz logs in, she types in her account
name, Blatz, and then her password, cradle. The system encrypts the
password into pn6yywersyq, and compares that to the entry in the
password file. If the encrypted entries don't match, Sally is booted
off the machine. The plain text password itself isn't compared, its
encryption is. Password security depends on the trapdoor function.</p>

<p>Trapdoor functions are mathematical ratchets: you can turn them
forwards, but not backwards. They quickly translate text into
ciphers. To make these locks pickproof, it's got to be impossible to
reverse the algorithm.</p>

<p>Our trapdoors were built upon the Data Encryption Standard (DBS),
created by IBM and the National Security Agency. We'd heard rumors
that the electronic spooks of NSA weakened the DES. They hobbled it
just enough to be crackable by NSA, but kept it strong enough to
resist the efforts of ordinary mortals. The grapevine said that this
way NSA could crack the code and read messages, but nobody else
could.</p>

<p>The cryptographic DES program within our Unix computer was
public. Anyone could study it. NSA had analyzed its strengths and
weaknesses, but these reports were secret. Occasionally, we'd heard
rumors of someone cracking this cipher, but none of these panned
out. Until NSA published its analyses of the DES, we'd have no choice
but to trust that our encryption was strong enough.</p>

<p>Wayne and I had watched the hacker break in and steal our password
file. The hacker now knew the names of a few hundred scientists. He
might as well have asked for our telephone book&#8212;at least that
included addresses. Unless he owned a Cray supercomputer, he couldn't
invert the trapdoor function, and our passwords remained safe.</p>

<p>Wayne was still worried. "Maybe this guy's stumbled on some
brilliant way to reverse the trapdoor function. Let's be a tad careful
and change our important passwords."<a id="p40" name="p40"></a></p>

<p>I could hardly object. The system password hadn't been changed for
a couple years, and outlasted people who had been hired and fired. I
didn't mind changing my password; to make sure, I used a different
password on each computer. If the hacker managed to figure out my
password from the Unix-4 computer, he'd still have no way to guess it
on the others.</p>

<p>Before pedaling home, I again studied the printout of the previous
day's session. Buried in the ten pages were clues to the hacker's
persona, location, and intentions. But too much conflicted: we traced
him through Tymnet into Oakland, California. But Dave didn't believe
he was from Berkeley. He copied our password file, yet our encryption
made those passwords into gibberish. What was he doing with our
encrypted passwords?</p>

<p>In some ways, this was like astronomy. We passively observed a
phenomenon, and from a few clues tried to explain the event and find
the location of the source. Astronomers are accustomed to quietly
gathering data, usually by freezing behind a telescope on a
mountaintop. Here the data appeared sporadically, from an unknown
source. Instead of thermodynamics and optics, I needed to understand
cryptography and operating systems. Somehow, a physical connection
existed between our system and a distant terminal. By applying
ordinary physics, it must be possible to understand what was
happening.</p>

<p>Physics: there was the key. Record your observations. Apply
physical principles. Speculate, but only trust proven conclusions. If
I were to make any progress, I'd have to treat the task as a freshman
physics problem. Time to update my notebook.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p class="first">And just in time. Wednesday, September 10, at 7:51
a.m., the hacker appeared in our system for six minutes. Long enough
to ring the alarm on my terminal, but not enough time to do anything
about it. I had stayed at home that <a id="p41" name="p41"></a> night:
"Five days at the lab are enough," Martha said.</p>

<p>I wasn't at the lab to watch, but the printer saved three pages of
the hacker's trail. He had logged into our Unix-4 computer as
Sventek. Well, I understand that&#8212;he had Sventek's password, and
had entered from Tymnet.</p>

<p>But he didn't hang around my Unix-4 computer. Instead he
leap-frogged through it and landed in the Milnet. Now it was no news
flash that the Milnet existed&#8212;it's a part of the Internet, a
computer network that cross-links a hundred other networks. From our
Unix computer, we can reach the Internet, and from there, the
Milnet.</p>

<p>The Milnet belongs to the Department of Defense.</p>

<p>My hacker connected to Milnet address 26.0.0.113, logged in there
as "Hunter," and checked that he had a copy of Gnu-Emacs, then
disappeared.</p>

<p>When I biked in around noon, there was no trace to follow
upstream. But the hacker left an indelible trail downstream. Where was
that Milnet address? The Network Information Center decoded it for me:
the U.S. Army Depot, in Anniston, Alabama. The home of the Army's
Redstone missile complex, two thousand miles away from Berkeley.</p>

<p>In a couple minutes, he'd connected through our lab and into some
Army base. The printout left little doubt that this was the
hacker. Nobody but the hacker would use Sventek's account. And who
else would check for the Gnu-Emacs security hole on some computer in
Alabama?</p>

<p>Nobody was around to tell me to ignore it, so I called Anniston
information. Sure enough, the Anniston Army Depot had a computer
center, and eventually I found Chuck McNatt, the Anniston Unix
wizard.</p>

<p>"Hi, Chuck. You don't know me but I think we found someone screwing
around with your computer."</p>

<p>"Who are you? How do I know <em>you're</em> not trying to break
in?"</p>

<p>After a few minutes of disbelief, he asked for my phone number,
hung up, and called me back. Here's someone that doesn't trust
strangers. Or did he call me back on a secure phone line?</p>

<p>"Bad news," I said. "I think I saw someone breaking into your
system."</p>

<p>"Aw, hell&#8212;that son of a bitch, Hunter?"<a id="p42"
name="p42"></a></p>

<p>"Yeah. How'd you know?"</p>

<p>"I've seen his ass before."</p>

<p>Chuck McNatt explained through a thick Alabama drawl that the
Army's Redstone Missile Arsenal kept track of its supplies on a couple
of Unix computers. To get orders processed quickly, they'd hooked up
to Chuck's computer at the Anniston Depot. Most of their traffic was
news updates&#8212;not many people logged in remotely.</p>

<p>One Saturday morning, to escape the August heat, Chuck had gone
into work and checked the users on his system. Someone named Hunter
was using up an enormous amount of computing time. Surprised to see
anyone on a Saturday, Chuck had flashed a message on Hunter's screen,
saying, "Hey! Identify yourself!"</p>

<p>The mysterious Hunter typed back, "Who do you think I am?"</p>

<p>Chuck wasn't that gullible. He sent another message, "Identify
yourself now or I'll knock you off the system!"</p>

<p>Back came Hunter's reply, "I cannot answer."</p>

<p>"So I bumped him off the machine," Chuck said. "We called the FBI,
but they didn't give a damn. So we talked CID into tracing every damn
connection coming in on our phone lines."</p>

<p>"What's the CID&#8212;Chestnut Inspection Department?"</p>

<p>"Be serious," Chuck said. "The CID's the Army's cops. The criminal
investigation division. But they're not doin' much."</p>

<p>"No classified material lost, huh?"</p>

<p>The FBI in Montgomery, Alabama, told Chuck about the same story as
Oakland had told me. They'd investigate when a million dollars
disappeared. Until then, don't bother 'em. Computer crimes weren't
sexy.</p>

<p>"Who'd you find?"</p>

<p>"The weirdest thing," Chuck continued. "I caught Hunter sneaking
into my computer two or three more times, but my telephone recorders
didn't show a thing."</p>

<p>"Betcha I know why. He's been coming in through your back
door. Your Milnet connection. Some hacker's been breaking into our
system, and he got into your computer this morning."</p>

<p>Chuck cursed&#8212;he'd missed the three-minute
connection. <a id="p43" name="p43"></a> He had set traps on all his
telephone lines, but hadn't thought to watch his network links.</p>

<p>"We're trying to find out who's hacking our system," I said. "We
figure he's a student here in Berkeley, and we're gearing up to track
him down. Our first trace points to Oakland or Berkeley."</p>

<p>"Well, I know how you feel. We all suspect it's a student here in
Alabama," Chuck said. "We thought about closing up, but we're out to
git him. I'd rather see him behind bars than behind a terminal."</p>

<p>For the first time, I worried for this hacker's welfare. If the
Army caught the guy, he'd have a rough time.</p>

<p>"Hey, Chuck, have I got a kicker for you. Betcha this guy's
super-user on your system."</p>

<p>"Naw. He might have stolen an account, but no way he'd get to be
super-user. We're an Army base, not some goofball college."</p>

<p>I let the swipe at Berkeley pass. "He went looking for your
Gnu-Emacs move-mail file."</p>

<p>"Yeah. So what?"</p>

<p>"What do you know about the nesting habits of cuckoos?" I explained
the workings of the Gnu-Emacs security hole.</p>

<p>Chuck was taken aback. "You mean we've had this hole since White
Sands sent us this Gnu file?" Chuck whistled. "I wonder how long he's
been poking around." He understood the hole and the implications.</p>

<p>The hacker listed files at the Anniston system. Judging from the
dates of these files, he'd been in Anniston's computers since early
June. For four months, an illegitimate system manager used an Alabama
Army computer. Yet he'd been discovered by accident, not through some
logic bomb or lost information.</p>

<p>No obvious damage.</p>

<p>Looking closely at the morning's printout, I saw that the hacker
had executed the change password command. On the Anniston computer, he
had changed Hunter's password to be "Hedges." A clue at last: of
zillions of possible passwords, he'd chosen Hedges. Hedges Hunter?
Hunter Hedges? A hedge hunter? Time to flip through the H's in the
Berkeley telephone book.</p>

<p>Three phone calls to H. Hunter turned up Harold, Heidi,<a id="p44"
name="p44"></a> and Hilda Hunter. "Hi, are you interested in a free
subscription to <em>Computer Reviews?"</em> No dice. None of them said
they cared about computers.</p>

<p>What does a physics lab in Berkeley have in common with an army
depot in Anniston, Alabama? You couldn't find more politically
opposite locations: a good-old-boy Army base and a radical hippie
town. Yet technically, we shared quite a bit. Both our computers ran
Unix and connected through the Milnet network.</p>

<p>But wait&#8212;Anniston's system ran AT&amp;T Unix, not the
Berkeley dialect. If I believed Dave Cleveland, then the hacker was at
home on Anniston's system. Might it be a Southern hacker?</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<p class="first">I couldn't stand the sterile, fluorescent lighted
halls of the lab anymore, so I went outside to look at the panoramic
view of the Bay Area below me. The Berkeley campus lay directly
beneath my laboratory. Once the home of the free speech movement and
antiwar protests, the campus is still known for its wild politics and
ethnic diversity. If I were a little closer, I could probably hear the
Young Republicans baiting the Socialist Workers, while the Chinese
Club looked on in amazement.</p>

<p>Smoky coffeehouses crowded next to the campus, where haggard grad
students scribbled their theses, fueled by espresso. At nearby ice
cream shops, giggling sorority girls mingled with punks in black
leather and spiked hair. Best of all&#8212;Berkeley's bookstores.</p>

<p>From the front of the lab, I could look farther south, to the
pleasant streets of north Oakland, where we lived. There I shared an
old bungalow with an assortment of zany roommates. Across the bay,
shrouded in fog, was San Francisco&#8212;Oz.</p>

<p>Three years ago, Martha had moved here to study law and I'd tagged
along. She'd been worth crossing the country for. She was a damned
good hiking partner and caver. I <a id="p45" name="p45"></a> first met
her when I fell thirty feet inside a cave; she came to the rescue,
rapelling down to where I lay incapacitated by a bad sprain and utter
infatuation. My injuries healed, thanks to her chicken soup; my
affection for the smart-aleck kid who climbed rocks so fearlessly
ripened into love.</p>

<p>Now we lived together. She actually enjoyed studying law. She
didn't want to be a lawyer, but a legal philosopher. She was obsessed
with aikido, a Japanese martial art, and often came home bruised but
grinning. She cooked, gardened, pieced quilts, did carpentry, and made
stained-glass windows. For all our zaniness, we wallowed in
disgustingly wholesome domestic bliss.</p>

<p>I bicycled home and told Martha about the Alabama break-in,
speculating about who might be behind it.</p>

<p>"So there's technocratic vandals," she said. "What else is
new?"</p>

<p>"That's news in itself. Technicians now have incredible power to
control information and communication," I said.</p>

<p>"So what? Somebody's always had control over information, and
others have always tried to steal it. Read Machiavelli. As technology
changes, sneakiness finds new expressions."</p>

<p>Martha was still giving me a history lesson when Claudia bustled
in, complaining about her fifth graders. Life in Berkeley usually
includes a roommate or two. Claudia was ours, and a perfect one at
that. She was generous and cheerful, eager to share her life, her
music, and her kitchen gadgets with us. She was a professional
violinist eking out a living by playing in two symphony orchestras and
a chamber music trio, and giving lessons to kids.</p>

<p>Claudia was seldom still or quiet. In her few moments between jobs,
she simultaneously cooked meals, talked on the phone, and played with
her dog.</p>

<p>At first I listened, but soon her voice became like the background
chirp of a parakeet while I worried about how malicious this hacker
might be. While I'm at home, how do I know what he's up to?</p>

<p>Claudia knew how to take my mind off the hacker: she brought home a
video, <em>Plan 9 from Outer Space&#8212;</em>aliens in tinfoil flying
saucers drag vampires from graves.</p>

<p>Wednesday, September 17, was a drizzly Berkeley day. As the only
California couple without a car, Martha and I<a id="p46"
name="p46"></a> had to bicycle through the rain. On my way into the
lab, I visited the switchyard, to check for any visits by the
hacker. Water dripped off my sopping hair onto the printout, smudging
the ink on the paper.</p>

<p>Sometime during the night, someone had connected to our computer,
and methodically tried to log into the Unix-4 computer. First they
tried to log into the Guest account, using the password "Guest." Then
they tried the Visitor account, with password "Visitor"; then accounts
Root, System, Manager, Service, and Sysop. After a couple of minutes,
the attacker left.</p>

<p>Could this be a different hacker? This guy didn't even try valid
accounts like Sventek or Stoll. He simply tried obvious account names
and simple Passwords. I wondered how often such an attack might
succeed.</p>

<p>Not often&#8212;with six-letter passwords a hacker had a better
chance of winning the lottery than randomly guessing a particular
password. Since the computer hangs up after a few log-in failures, the
attacker would need all night to try even a few hundred possible
passwords. No, a hacker couldn't magically enter my system. He'd need
to know at least one password.</p>

<p>By 12:29, most of my clothes had dried off, though my sneakers
still squished. I was part way into a soggy bagel, and most of the way
through an astronomy article about physics of the icy satellites of
Jupiter. My terminal beeped. Trouble in the switchyard. A quick
(though squeaky) trot down the hallway let me watch the hacker connect
into our system as Sventek.</p>

<p>Again the adrenaline rush: I called Tymnet and quickly found Ron
Vivier. Ron started the trace, and I huddled over the Decwriter, which
now tapped out the hacker's commands.</p>

<p>The hacker wasted no time. He issued commands to show all the
active users and any background jobs running. He then fired up
Kermit.</p>

<p>Named after the Muppet hero, Kermit is the universal language for
connecting computers together. In 1980, Frank da Cruz of Columbia
University needed to send data to a number of different
computers. Instead of writing five different, incompatible programs,
he created a single standard to exchange files between any
systems. Kermit's become the Esperanto of computers.<a id="p47"
name="p47"></a></p>

<p>Absentmindedly chewing on a bagel, I watched as the hacker used
Kermit to transfer a short program into our Unix computer. Line by
line, faithful Kermit reassembled it, and soon I could read the
following program:</p>

<pre>
echo -n "WELCOME TO THE LBL DNIX4 COMPUTER" echo -n "PLEASE LOG IN
NOW" echo -n "LOGIN:" read account_name echo -n "ENTER YOUR PASSWORD:"
(stty -echo; \ read password; \ stty echo; \ echo" "; \ echo
$account__name $password &gt;&gt; /tmp/.pub) echo "SORRY, TRY AGAIN."
</pre>

<p>Yikes! Now here was a strange program! This program, when installed
in our computer, would prompt a user to enter his name and
password. An ordinary user who ran this program would see on his
screen:</p>

<pre>
WELCOME TO THE LBL UNIX4 COMPUTER PLEASE LOGIN NOW Login:
</pre>

<p>His terminal would then wait until he entered his account
name. After he typed his name, the system responds:</p>

<pre>
ENTER YOUR PASSWORD:
</pre>

<p>And he'd naturally type in his password. The program then stashes
the unlucky user's name and password into a file, tells the user,</p>

<pre>
"SORRY, TRY AGAIN"
</pre>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">and then disappears.</p>

<p>Thinking they've mistyped their passwords, most people will just
try to log in again. By then, their password will already have been
stolen.<a id="p48" name="p48"></a></p>

<p>Four thousand years ago, the city of Troy fell when Greek soldiers
snuck in, hidden inside the Trojan horse.</p>

<p>Deliver a gift that looks attractive, yet steals the very key to
your security. Sharpened over the millennia, this technique still
works against everyone except the truly paranoid.</p>

<p>The hacker's Trojan horse program collected passwords. Our visitor
wanted our passwords badly enough to risk getting caught installing a
program that was bound to be detected.</p>

<p>Was this program a Trojan horse? Maybe I should call it a
mockingbird: a false program that sounded like the real thing. I
didn't have time to figure out the difference&#8212;within a minute,
he was bound to install his program in the systems area, and start it
running. What should I do? To disable it would show him that I was
watching him. Yet doing nothing would give him a new password every
time someone logged in.</p>

<p>But legitimate super-users have power too. Before the hacker could
run his program, I changed one line in it, making it look like he'd
made a trivial error. Then I diddled a couple system parameters to
slow down the system. Slow enough that the hacker would need ten
minutes to rebuild his program. Enough time to let us respond to this
new attack.</p>

<p>I shouted down the hall for Guru Dave.</p>

<p>"What do you feed a Trojan horse?"</p>

<p>Dave came running. We shifted the computer into high speed, and
prepared a fodder of bogus accounts and false passwords.</p>

<p>But our panic wasn't necessary. The hacker rebuilt his Trojan
horse, but didn't install it properly. Dave instantly realized that it
had been placed in the wrong directory. His Trojan horse would be
happy in standard AT&amp;T Unix, but couldn't cavort in the fields of
Berkeley Unix.</p>

<p>Dave grinned. "I won't say, 'I told you so,' but we're watching
someone who's never been to California. Every Unix jockey on the West
Coast would use Berkeley style commands, yet your hacker's still using
AT&amp;T Unix."</p>

<p>Dave descended from his tower to explain what he meant. "The
spelling of his commands is different from Berkeley Unix. But so is
the very feel of the program. Kinda like how you can tell that a
writer is British rather than American. Sure, you'll see words like
'colour' and 'defence,' but you can feel the style difference as
well."</p>

<p><a id="p49" name="p49"></a> "So what's the difference?" I
asked.</p>

<p>Dave sneered, "The hacker used the command 'read' to get keyboard
data. Any civilized programmer would use the 'set' command." For Dave,
civilized computers spoke Berkeley Unix. All others were uncouth.</p>

<p>The hacker didn't realize this. Confident that he'd put his Trojan
horse in the right pasture, he ran it as a background process, and
logged off. Before he disconnected, Ron Vivier had traced the hacker
through Tymnet's network, and into an Oakland, California, telephone
line. The dust hadn't yet settled on our court order, so we couldn't
start the phone trace.</p>

<p>The hacker had left, but his Trojan horse stayed behind, running as
a background task. As Dave predicted, it collected no passwords, for
it had been installed in a place that wasn't referenced during
log-in. Sure enough, twenty minutes later, the hacker reappeared,
searched for a collection of passwords, and must have been
disappointed to find his program had failed.</p>

<p>"Look, Dave, the poor guy needs your help," I said.</p>

<p>"Right. Should we send him some electronic mail telling him how to
write a Trojan horse program that works?" Dave replied.</p>

<p>"He's got the basics right&#8212;imitating our log-in sequence,
asking for the username and password, then storing the stolen
information. All he needs is a few lessons in Berkeley Unix."</p>

<p>Wayne stopped by to watch the hacker flounder. "Aw, what do you
expect? There's just too many varieties of Unix. Next time make it
easier on those inept hackers, and give them Digital's VMS operating
system. It might not be easier to hack, but at least it's
standardized. IOTTMCO." Intuitively obvious to the most casual
observer.</p>

<p>Wayne had a good point. The hacker's Trojan horse attack had failed
because the operating system wasn't exactly what he was accustomed
to. If everyone used the same version of the same operating system, a
single security hole would let hackers into all the
computers. Instead, there's a multitude of operating systems: Berkeley
Unix, AT&amp;T Unix, DEC's VMS, IBM's TSO, VM, DOS, even Macintoshes
and Ataris. This variety of software meant that no single attack could
succeed against all systems. Just<a id="p50" name="p50"></a> like
genetic diversity, which prevents an epidemic from wiping out a whole
species at once, diversity in software is a good thing.</p>

<p>Dave and Wayne continued bickering as they left the switchyard. I
hung around a few more minutes, reloading paper. At 1:30 P.M., the
hacker reappeared; I was still adjusting the printer when he started
typing.</p>

<p>This second session was predictable. Our visitor looked at his
special file for passwords and found none. He listed his Trojan horse
program and tested it a couple times. It didn't work. Apparently, he
didn't have a Dave Cleveland for help. Obviously frustrated, he erased
the file and logged off in a couple minutes.</p>

<p>But even though he'd been on for only a few minutes, Tymnet managed
to trace him, again into Oakland. Ron Vivier, who'd traced Tymnet's
connections, apparently welcomed any emergency that might extricate
him from a meeting, so he jumped when I called. If we could only get
the phone company to continue the trace, we could wrap up everything
in a couple days.</p>

<p>Dave felt he could exclude anyone coming from the West Coast. Chuck
in Anniston suspected a hacker from Alabama. Tymnet's traces pointed
to Oakland.</p>

<p>Me? I didn't know.</p>

<h3>10</h3>

<p class="first">Our Tymnet traces reached into Oakland, at various
times the home of Jack London, Ed Meese, and Gertrude Stein. A
twenty-minute bike ride from the Berkeley campus led to the Oakland
Paramount Theater, with its sublime art-deco architecture and
eye-popping murals. A few blocks away, in the basement of an ugly
modem building, Tymnet rents space for fifty dialup modems. Ron Vivier
had traced the hacker from our lab into this bank of modems. Now it
was my local telephone company's turn.</p>

<p>A two-inch-thick cable runs under Broadway, connecting Tymnet's
modems to an unmarked, windowless building.<a id="p51" name="p51"></a>
There, Pacific Bell's Franklin office houses an electronic switch to
handle ten thousand telephone lines in area code 415 with the prefix
430. Tymnet leases fifty of these lines.</p>

<p>From somewhere, the hacker had dialed 415/430-2900. The path to our
mysterious visitor led to Pac Bell's ESS-5 switch.</p>

<p>Across San Francisco Bay, Lee Cheng's office overlooks a grungy
alley off Market Street. Lee is Pac Bell's bloodhound; from his office
or up on a telephone pole, he traces phone lines.</p>

<p>Lee's degree is in criminology, and his graduate work is in
accident reconstruction and causation. But eight years of telephone
tracing gives him an engineer's view of the phone company and a cop's
view of society. To him, communities are split by area codes,
exchanges, and trunk lines, as well as precincts and
neighborhoods.</p>

<p>With advance warning, Lee starts a software program in the computer
that runs the telephone exchange. At the switching control center, he
logs onto the ESS maintenance channel, brings up
line-condition-monitoring software, and starts a trap program.</p>

<p>The automatic trap program monitors the status of an individual
telephone line. It records the date, time, how many rings before an
answer, and where the call came from.</p>

<p>If the call came from a nearby phone&#8212;one from the same
exchange&#8212;then the trace is complete, and Lee's job is easy. More
often, the call comes from another exchange, and Lee has to coordinate
traces at perhaps five different phone exchanges.</p>

<p>When a technician at an exchange receives a trace call, he drops
what he's doing&#8212;Lee's traces take precedence over everything
except firefighting. He logs into the control computer, commands his
computer to display the phone number's status (busy, idle, off-hook),
and executes programs to show where the connection came from (routing
index, trunk group number, adjacent exchange name).</p>

<p>With luck, the trace might take a few seconds. But a few exchanges,
left over from the 1950s, still use mechanical-stepping switches. When
you dial through these exchanges, you can hear a soft pulsing in the
background, as relays move a lever in tune with your dialing. The old
grackles of the telephone system are proud of these antiques,
saying,<a id="p52" name="p52"></a> "They're the only switches that'll
survive a nuclear attack." But they complicate Lee's job: he's got to
find a technician to run from rack to rack tracing these calls.</p>

<p>Local telephones can only be traced while connected. Once you hang
up, the connection evaporates and can no longer be traced. So Lee
races against time to finish a trace before the connection is
lost.</p>

<p>Phone companies view phone traces as a waste of time. Only their
most skilled technicians know how to trace a phone connection. Worse,
traces are expensive, generate lawsuits, and upset customers.</p>

<p>Lee, of course, sees things otherwise. "Yesterday was a drug bust,
today, it's an extortion racket, tomorrow we're tracing a burglary
ring. Obscene phone calls around the full moon. Lately, we've been
tracing call girls' pocket pagers. Slice of life in the big city."
Still, the fear of lawyers keeps him from unofficially helping
out.</p>

<p>Our conversation in September 1986 was curt:</p>

<p>"Hey, we need a telephone line traced."</p>

<p>"Got a search warrant?"</p>

<p>"No, do we need one?"</p>

<p>"We won't trace without a warrant."</p>

<p>That was quick. No progress until Aletha Owens got the court
order.</p>

<p>After yesterday's attack, we couldn't wait. My searches through the
phone book were leading nowhere. A more competent Trojan horse would
panic my boss into closing down the investigation. And my three-week
allowance was down to ten days.</p>

<p>Sandy Merola was Roy Keith's sidekick. When Roy's acid tongue got
to one of the staff, Sandy applied balm. On a mission to the Berkeley
campus, Sandy noticed a set of IBM personal computers in a public
section of the library. Like any computer jock would do, he wandered
over and tried to use them. Just as he suspected, these computers were
programmed to automatically dial Tymnet and log into the Dow Jones
Information Service.</p>

<p>Tymnet? Sandy spent a few minutes diddling on the terminal, and
discovered that he could find the latest stock quotations and
financial rumors from <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> More
important, when he signed off the Dow Jones service,<a id="p53"
name="p53"></a> the terminal prompted him for, "Tymnet username?"
Seemed like nothing to lose by trying, so he entered, "LBL." Sure
enough, Sandy connected to my lab's computers.</p>

<p>Maybe these public terminals explained things. Anyone could use
them; they dialed the Oakland Tymnet number; and the library was all
of a hundred feet away from Cory Hall, where the Berkeley Unix jockeys
hang out.</p>

<p>Sandy was a jogger the way some people are Catholics. He trotted up
Cardiac Hill and told the police of his discovery. Here was a way to
avoid a phone trace&#8212;the next time the hacker appeared, we'd just
duck over to the library and grab the bastard. We didn't even need a
court order.</p>

<p>Sandy returned from the police station, still sweating. He caught
me practicing a yo-yo trick.</p>

<p>"Cut the clowning, Cliff. The police are all set to run over to the
campus and arrest whoever's using those terminals."</p>

<p>Being more accustomed to parking tickets and medical emergencies,
the LBL police don't understand computers and are pretty wary of
telephone traces. But they had no problem with busting someone
breaking into a computer.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better make sure that it's the hacker, first?" I had
visions of some undercover cops staking out a terminal and dragging a
librarian into the paddy wagon for checking the Dow Jones
industrials.</p>

<p>"It's easy. Call me the next time the hacker shows up. I'll drive
down to the library with the police, and we'll see what's on the
screen. If it's data from LBL, then we'll leave it to the police."</p>

<p>"Are they gonna stake out the terminal? You know, like in
'Dragnet'? With one-way mirrors and binoculars?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Be serious, Cliff." Sandy jogged away. I guess scientists are
graded in seriousness. It reminded me of when I'd filed a student
health report, listing under complaints, "Potato Famine." The doctor
called me aside and lectured me, "Son, we take health seriously around
here."</p>

<p>We got our chance to test Sandy's theory soon enough. Two days
after his failed Trojan horse, the hacker returned at 12:42 P.M. Lunch
hour. The perfect time for a Berkeley student to wander over to the
library and use their terminals.</p>

<p>At the alarm, I called Sandy. Five minutes later, he appeared with
two undercover police agents, wearing suits,<a id="p54"
name="p54"></a> ties, and winter coats. Nothing could be more
conspicuous on a campus of hippies on a hot summer day. I glimpsed a
large revolver under one of the cop's coats. They were serious.</p>

<p>For the next twenty-five minutes, the hacker didn't do much. He
became super-user via the Gnu-Emacs hole, listed the day's electronic
mail, and scanned through our processes. Ron Vivier skipped lunch to
trace the Tymnet connection into Oakland. Any minute, I expected to
see the printer suddenly stop, signaling that Sandy and the
constabulary had caught their man. But no, the hacker took his time
and logged off at 1:20.</p>

<p>Sandy returned a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"No luck, huh?" His face said it all.</p>

<p>"Nobody was at the library's terminals. Nobody even near them. Are
you sure the hacker was on?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, here's the printout. And Tymnet traced it into Oakland
again."</p>

<p>Sandy was let down. Our shortcut hit a dead end: progress now
depended on a telephone trace.</p>

<h3>11</h3>

<p class="first">That evening, Martha was supposed to be studying
constitutional law, but was actually piecing a calico quilt. I came
home discouraged: the library stakeout had seemed so promising.</p>

<p>"Forget the hacker. You're home now."</p>

<p>"But he might be in my system right now." I was obsessing.</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothing you can do about it, then. Here, thread a
needle and help with this seam." Martha escaped law school by
quilting; surely it would work for me as well. After twenty minutes of
silence, while she studied, my sewing started to get crooked.</p>

<p>"When we get the warrant, we'll have to wait until the hacker shows
up. For all we know, that'll be at 3 a.m., and nobody will be
around."</p>

<p>"I said, forget the hacker. You're home now." She didn't even look
up from her book.<a id="p55" name="p55"></a> Sure enough, the hacker
didn't show up the next day. But the search warrant did. It was legal
now. Of course, I couldn't be trusted to start anything as important
as a phone trace: Roy Kerth was explicit that only he was to talk to
the police.</p>

<p>We went through a couple dry runs, making sure we knew who to call
and checking that we could unwind our own local network. Then I got
bored and went back to writing some software to analyze optical
formulas for an astronomer.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Roy called our systems people and operators
together. He lectured us about the need to keep our traces
secret&#8212;we didn't know where the hacker was coming from, so we
mustn't mention our work to anyone outside the lab. I figured that
people would talk less if they knew what was going on, so I gave a
chalk talk about what we'd seen and where we were heading. Dave
Cleveland chipped in about the Gnu-Emacs hole, and Wayne pointed out
that we'd better discuss the hacker strictly by voice, since he
regularly read our electronic mail. The meeting broke up with Boris
and Natasha imitations.</p>

<p>Tuesday, at 12:42 in the afternoon, Sventek's account lit up. Roy
called the laboratory police&#8212;they wanted to be in charge of the
phone traces. By the time Tymnet had unwound their network, Roy was
shouting over the phone. I could hear his side of the
conversation.</p>

<p>"We need a number traced. We have the search warrant. Now."</p>

<p>Silence for a moment. Then he exploded.</p>

<p>"I don't give a damn about your problems!! Start the trace
now!"</p>

<p>More silence.</p>

<p>"If you don't get a trace immediately, you'll hear about it from
the lab director." Roy slammed down the receiver.</p>

<p>The boss was furious&#8212;his face turned purple. "Damn our
police! They've never handled a phone trace, and they don't know who
to call at the phone company!" Sheesh. At least his anger was aimed
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was for the best. The hacker disconnected within a
couple minutes, after just listing the names of the active users. By
the time the phone trace was started, there'd be no connection to
trace.<a id="p56" name="p56"></a></p>

<p>While the boss cooled off, I took the printout to study. There
wasn't much to summarize in my logbook. The hacker had just logged in,
listed the users, then logged off. Didn't even check the mail.</p>

<p>Aah! I saw why he logged off so fast. The system operator was
around. The hacker must know the sysops's name. He had raised
periscope, seen the enemy, then disappeared. Sure enough, looking back
to other printouts, he stayed around only when no operators were
around. Paranoid.</p>

<p>I talked with each of our operators, explaining this
discovery. From now on, they would run the system covertly, using
pseudonyms.</p>

<p>September 16 marked the end of the second week on the trail. I
tried working on optics again, but my mind kept drifting to the
printouts. Sure enough, just after noon, my terminal beeped: the
hacker had returned.</p>

<p>I called Tymnet, and then the boss. This time, we set up a
conference call, and I listened to the trace as I watched the hacker
walk through our system.</p>

<p>"Hi, Ron, it's Cliff. We need another trace on our Tymnet line,
LBL, Tymnet node 128, port 3."</p>

<p>A minute of fumbling on the other end.</p>

<p>"Looks like it's the third modem in our block of 1200-baud
lines. That would make it line 2903. That's 415/430-2903."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Ron." The police heard this, and relayed it to Lee Cheng
at the phone company.</p>

<p>"That's coming from the Franklin switch. Hold on." I was accustomed
to being put on hold by the phone company.</p>

<p>I watched the hacker fire up the Gnu-Emacs move-mail file. He was
becoming super-user. He'd be on for at least another ten
minutes. Maybe long enough to complete a trace. Come on, Pac Bell!</p>

<p>Three minutes passed by. Lee came back on line.</p>

<p>"The line's active, all right. Connects to a trunk leading into
Berkeley. I've got a technician checking that line right now."</p>

<p>Another two minutes pass by. The hacker's super-user now. He goes
straight for the system manager's mail files.</p>

<p>"The Berkeley technician shows the line connecting to AT&amp;T long
lines. Hold on." But Lee doesn't punch hold, and I listen in on his
conversation with the Berkeley office. The guy in Berkeley insists
that the line's coming from far<a id="p57" name="p57"></a> away; Lee's
telling him to check it again. Meanwhile the hacker is working on our
password file. Editing it, I think, but I'm trying to hear what's
happening at the phone company.</p>

<p>"It's our trunk group 369, and damn it, that's routed to 5096MCLN."
The Berkeley technician was speaking in tongues.</p>

<p>"OK, I guess we'll have to call New Jersey." Lee seemed
dismayed. "Cliff, are you still there?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. What's going on?"</p>

<p>"No matter. Is he going to stay on much longer?"</p>

<p>I watched the printout. The hacker left our password file and was
cleaning up his temporary files.</p>

<p>"I can't tell. My guess is&#8212;oops, he's logged off."</p>

<p>"Disconnected from Tymnet." Ron Vivier had been quiet until
now.</p>

<p>"Dropped off the phone line." Lee's trace disappeared.</p>

<p>Our police officer came on line. "Well, gentlemen, what's the
story?"</p>

<p>Lee Cheng spoke first. "I think the call's coming from the East
Coast. There's a slight chance that it's a local Berkeley call,
but... no, it's from AT&amp;T." Lee was thinking out loud, like a
graduate student at an oral exam. "All our Pacific Bell trunk lines
are labeled with three digits; only the long-distance trunks have
four-digit identifiers. That line ... let me look it up.</p>

<p>I heard Lee type into his computer.</p>

<p>Lee came back in a minute. "Hey, Cliff, do you know anyone in
Virginia? Maybe Northern Virginia?"</p>

<p>"No. There's no particle accelerators near there. Not even a
physics lab. Of course, my sister's there ..."</p>

<p>"Think your sister's breaking into your computer?"</p>

<p>Yeah, sure. My sister was a tech writer for the goddamn Navy. She
even attended night school at the Navy War College.</p>

<p>"If she is," I replied, "I'm the pope of San Francisco."</p>

<p>"Well then, we can't go any further today. Next time, I'll make the
trace faster."</p>

<p>It was hard to imagine a faster trace. I'd taken five minutes
getting everyone on line. Ron Vivier had spent two minutes tracing the
call through Tymnet; it had taken Lee Cheng another seven minutes to
snake through several<a id="p58" name="p58"></a> telephone
exchanges. In a shade under a quarter hour, we'd traced the hacker
through a computer and two networks.</p>

<p>Here was a conundrum. Sandy Merola felt the hacker came from the
Berkeley campus. Dave Cleveland was certain he came from anywhere
except Berkeley. Chuck McNatt from Anniston suspected someone from
Alabama. The Tymnet trace led to Oakland, California. Now Pacific Bell
said Virginia. Or was it New Jersey?</p>

<p>With each session my logbook grew. It wasn't enough to just
summarize what had happened. I began to annotate each printout and
search for correlations between sessions. I wanted to know my visitor:
understand his wishes, predict his moves, find his address, and learn
his name.</p>

<p>While trying to coordinate the traces, I'd pretty much ignored what
the hacker was actually doing. After the tension died down, I hid in
the library with the printout from his most recent connection.</p>

<p>Right off, it was obvious that the fifteen minutes which I'd
watched were only the coda of the hacker's work. For two hours, he had
been connected to our system; I'd only noticed him during the last
quarter hour. Damn. If only I'd detected him right away. Two hours
would have been enough to complete a trace.</p>

<p>More damning, though, was why I hadn't noticed him. I'd been
watching for activity on Sventek's account, but he had used three
other accounts before touching Sventek's account.</p>

<p>At 11:09 in the morning, some hacker had logged into an account
belonging to a nuclear physicist, Elissa Mark. This account was valid,
billed to the nuclear sciences department, though its owner had been
on sabbatical at Fermilab for the past year. It took just one phone
call to find that Elissa was unaware of anyone using her computer
account; she didn't even know if it still existed. Was this the same
hacker that I'd been following? Or someone else?</p>

<p>I had no way of knowing in advance that the Mark account had been
hacked. But paging through the printout left little doubt.</p>

<p>Whoever was using the Mark account had become super-user by
crawling through the Gnu-Emacs hole. As system manager, he searched
for accounts that hadn't been used in<a id="p59" name="p59"></a> a
long time. He found three: Mark, Goran, and Whitberg. The latter two
belonged to physicists long departed from our lab.</p>

<p>He edited the password file and breathed life into the three dead
accounts. Since none of these accounts had been deleted, all their
files and accounting information remained valid. To steal these
accounts, the hacker needed to learn their passwords. But the
passwords were protected by encryption: our DBS trapdoor functions. No
hacker could cut through that armor.</p>

<p>With his purloined super-user powers, the hacker edited the
system-wide password file. He didn't try to decrypt Goran's encrypted
password; instead, he erased it. Now that the account had no password,
the hacker could log in as Goran.</p>

<p>With this he disconnected. What's he up to? He couldn't crack
passwords, but as super-user, he didn't have to. He just edited the
password file.</p>

<p>He reappeared a minute later as Goran, then chose a new password
for this account&#8212;Benson. The next time Rodger Goran tried to use
our Unix computer, he'd be frustrated to find his old password no
longer worked.</p>

<p>Our hacker had stolen another account.</p>

<p>Aah&#8212;here's why the hacker stole old accounts. If he stole
active accounts, people would complain when their familiar passwords
no longer worked. So my adversary stole old accounts that weren't used
anymore. Robbing the dead.</p>

<p>Even as super-user, he couldn't undo the DBS trapdoor. So he
couldn't figure out someone else's password. But he could swipe
passwords, with a Trojan horse, or steal a whole account, by changing
the password to a new word.</p>

<p>Having stolen the Goran account, he then grabbed the Whitberg
account. The hacker now controlled at least four accounts, Sventek,
Whitberg, Goran, and Mark, on two of our Unix computers. How many
other accounts did he hold? On which other systems?</p>

<p>While running under Whitberg's pseudonym, the hacker tried to
connect through our Milnet link into three Air Force systems. After
waiting a minute for those distant computers to respond, he gave up,
and started listing files belonging to LBL folks. He grew tired of
this after reading<a id="p60" name="p60"></a> a few scientific papers,
several boring research proposals, and a detailed description of how
to measure the nuclear cross section of some beryllium
isotope. Yawn. Breaking into computers sure wasn't the key to power,
fame, and the wisdom of the ages.</p>

<p>Getting into our two Unix systems hadn't satisfied my voracious
foe. He'd tried hurdling the moat around our secured Unix-8 computer,
but failed&#8212;Dave had sealed off that machine. Frustrated at this,
he printed a list of remote computers available from our site.</p>

<p>Nothing secret there, just the names, phone numbers, and electronic
addresses for thirty Berkeley computers.</p>

<h3>12</h3>

<p class="first">With the full moon, I expected more hacking and
planned on sleeping under the desk. The hacker didn't show up that
evening, but Martha did. Around seven, she hiked up, bringing a
thermos of minestrone and some quilting to keep me occupied. There's
no shortcut to hand stitching a quilt. Each triangle, square, and
parallelogram must be cut to size, ironed, assembled, and sewn to its
neighbors. Up close, it's hard to tell the pieces from the scraps. The
design becomes visible only after the scraps are discarded, and you
stitch the pieces together. Hmmm. A lot like understanding this
hacker.</p>

<p>Around 11:30, I gave up my watch. If the hacker wanted to show up
at midnight, the printers would catch him anyway.</p>

<p>The next day, the hacker turned up once. I missed him, preferring
to share lunch with Martha just off campus. It was worth it: on a
street corner, a jazz band played 1930s tunes.</p>

<p>The singer belted out some '30s ditty, "Everybody loves my baby,
but my baby loves nobody but me."</p>

<p>"That's absurd," Martha said between tunes. "Logically analyzed,
the singer must be his own baby."</p>

<p>"Huh?" It sounded fine to me.</p>

<p>"Look. 'Everybody' includes my baby. Since 'Everybody<a id="p61"
name="p61"></a> loves my baby,' then my baby loves
herself. Right?"</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah." I tried to follow.</p>

<p>"But then he says, 'My baby loves nobody but me.' So my baby, who
must love herself, cannot love anyone else. Therefore, my baby must be
me."</p>

<p>She explained it twice before I understood. The singer had never
learned elementary logic. Neither had I.</p>

<p>By the time I returned from lunch, the hacker was long gone,
leaving his trail on a paper printout.</p>

<p>For once, he didn't become super-user. Yes, in his paranoid way, he
checked for systems people and monitoring processes, but he didn't
sneak through the hole in the operating system.</p>

<p>Instead, he went fishing over the Milnet.</p>

<p>A single isolated computer, out of communication with the world, is
immune to attack. But a hermit computer has limited value; it can't
keep up with what's happening around it. Computers are of the greatest
use when they interact with people, mechanisms, and other
computers. Networks let people share data, programs, and electronic
mail.</p>

<p>What's on a computer network? What do computers have to say to each
other? Most personal computers satisfy the needs of their owners, and
don't need to talk to other systems. For word processing, accounting
spreadsheets, and games, you really don't need any other
computers. But hook up a modem to your computer, and your telephone
will report the latest from the stock market, news wires, and rumor
mills. Connecting to another computer gives you a powerful way to tune
in the latest news.</p>

<p>Our networks form neighborhoods, each with a sense of
community. The high-energy physics networks transfer lots of data
about subatomic particles, research proposals, as well as gossip about
who's pushing for a Nobel prize. Unclassified military networks
probably pass along orders for shoes, requests for funding, and rumors
of who's jockeying for base commander. Somewhere, I'll bet there are
classified networks, to exchange secret military orders and top secret
gossip like who's sleeping with the base commander.</p>

<p>These electronic communities are bounded by the limits of their
communications protocols. Simple networks, like<a id="p62"
name="p62"></a> public bulletin boards, use the simplest ways to
communicate. Anyone with a personal computer and a telephone can link
into them. Advanced networks require leased telephone lines and
dedicated computers, interconnecting hundreds or thousands of
computers. These physical differences set boundaries between
networks. The networks themselves are linked together by gateway
computers, which pass reformatted messages between different
networks.</p>

<p>Like Einstein's universe, most networks are finite but
unbounded. There's only a certain number of computers attached, yet
you never quite reach the edge of the network. There's always another
computer down the line. Eventually, you'll make a complete circuit and
wind up back where you started. Most networks are so complicated and
interwoven that no one knows where all their connections lead, so most
people have to explore to find their way around.</p>

<p>Our lab's computers connect to a dozen computer networks. Some of
them are local, like the ethernet that ties computers in one building
to a lab next door. Other nets reach to an extended community: the Bay
Area Research Net links a dozen northern California
universities. Finally, the national and international networks let our
scientists connect to computers around the world. But the premier
network is the Internet.</p>

<p>In the mid 1950s, the Federal government started building the
interstate highway system, a twentieth-century marvel of pork-barrel
public-works politics. With memories of wartime transportation
shortages, military leaders made certain that the interstate system
could handle tanks, military convoys, and troop carriers. Today, few
think of interstate highways as a military system, though they're just
as capable of sending tanks across the country as trucks.</p>

<p>With the same reasoning, the Department of Defense began developing
a network to link military computers together. In 1969, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) experiments evolved into
the Arpanet and then into the Internet: an electronic highway
interconnecting a hundred-thousand computers around the world.</p>

<p>In the world of computing, the Internet is at least as successful
as the interstate system. Both have been<a id="p63" name="p63"></a>
overwhelmed by their success, and every day carry traffic far beyond
what their designers dreamed. Each regularly inspires complaints of
traffic jams, inadequate routes, shortsighted planning, and inadequate
maintenance. Yet even these complaints reflect the phenomenal
popularity of what was an uncertain experiment only a few years
ago.</p>

<p>At first, DARPA's network was simply a testbed to prove that
computers could be linked together. Since it was seen as an unreliable
experiment, universities and laboratories used it, and mainstream
military people ignored it. After eight years, only a few hundred
computers connected into the Arpanet, but gradually, others were
attracted by the network's reliability and simplicity. By 1985 the
network directory listed tens of thousands of computers; today, there
must be over one hundred thousand. Taking a census of networked
computers would be like counting the cities and towns reachable from
the interstate system&#8212;it's hard to name many places which can't
be reached via some convoluted route.</p>

<p>The network's growing pains have been reflected in name
changes. The first Arpanet was a backbone connecting random
university, military, and defense contractor computers. As military
people grew to depend on the network for carrying messages and mail,
they decided to split the network into a military portion, the Milnet,
and a research section, the Arpanet.</p>

<p>But there's not much difference between the military and academic
nets, and gateways let traffic flow between them. Indeed, any Arpanet
user can connect to any Milnet computer without so much as an
invitation. Together, the Arpanet, Milnet, and a hundred other
networks make up the Internet.</p>

<p>There are thousands of university, commercial, and military
computers connected through the Internet. Like buildings in a city,
each has a unique address; most of these addresses are registered at
the Network Information Center (NIC) in Menlo Park, California. Any
one computer may have dozens or hundreds of people using it, so
individuals as well as computers are registered in the NIC.</p>

<p>The NIC's computers provide a directory: just connect to the NIC
and ask for someone, and it'll tell you where<a id="p64"
name="p64"></a> they're located. They don't have much luck keeping
their database up to date (computer people change jobs often), but the
NIC still serves as a good phone directory of computer people.</p>

<p>During my lunch break, the hacker ducked into the NIC. Our printer
quietly saved the session as he searched the NIC for the abbreviation,
"WSMR":</p>

<p>WSMR? White Sands Missile Range. With two commands and twenty
seconds, he found five computers at White Sands.</p>

<p>Astronomers know Sunspot, New Mexico, as one of the finest solar
observatories. Clear skies and great telescopes make up for the utter
isolation of Sacramento Peak, a few hundred miles south of
Albuquerque. The only road to the observatory runs through White
Sands, where the Army tests their guided missiles. Once, when I was
studying the solar corona, an observing run took me to Sunspot, past
the desolation of White Sands. The locked gates and guardhouses
discourage onlookers; if the sun doesn't fry you, the electric fences
will.</p>

<p>I'd heard rumors that the Army was designing rockets to<a id="p65"
name="p65"></a> shoot down satellites. Seemed like an SDI/Star Wars
project, but civilian astronomers can only guess. Maybe this hacker
knew more about White Sands than I did.</p>

<p>No doubt, though, that the hacker wanted to know more about White
Sands. He spent ten minutes trying to log into each of their
computers, connecting to them over the Internet.</p>

<p>The printer recorded his steps:</p>

<pre>

<p>For each computer, he tried to log in as guest, visitor, root, and
system. We saw him failing, time after time, as he tried to guess
passwords. Perhaps those accounts were valid; the hacker couldn't
enter them because he didn't know the right passwords.</p>

<p>I smiled at the printout. No doubt, the hacker wanted to get into
White Sands. But they didn't fool around with security. Between their
electric fences and passwords, neither tourist nor hacker could
enter. Someone at White Sands had locked their doors.</p>

<p>With a snicker, I showed his attempts to the boss, Roy Keith.</p>

<p>"Well, what do we do about it?" I asked. "Since he didn't get into
White Sands, should we tell them?"<a id="p66" name="p66"></a></p>

<p>"Hell, yes, we'll tell them," Roy responded. "If someone tries to
break into my neighbor's house, I'll tell 'em. I'll call the cops,
too."</p>

<p>I asked what cops were in charge of the Internet.</p>

<p>"Damned if I know," Roy said. "But here's our policy, from here
out: anyone that's attacked, we tell them. I don't care if the hacker
didn't get in, you call them on the phone and tell them. Remember,
keep this out of electronic mail. And find out who the cops are."</p>

<p>"Yessir."</p>

<p>It took only one phone call to find out that the FBI wasn't
policing the Internet. "Look, kid, did you lose more than a half
million dollars?"</p>

<p>"Uh, no."</p>

<p>"Any classified information?"</p>

<p>"Uh, no."</p>

<p>"Then go away, kid." Another attempt at rousing the feds had
failed.</p>

<p>Maybe the Network Information Center would know who policed their
net. I called Menlo Park and eventually found Nancy Fischer. To her,
the Internet wasn't just a collection of cables and software. It was a
living creature, a brain with neurons extending round the world, into
which ten thousand computer users breathed life every hour. Nancy was
fatalistic: "It's a miniature of the society around us. Sooner or
later, some vandal's going to try to kill it."</p>

<p>It seemed that there were no network police. Since the
Milnet&#8212;now called the Defense Data Network&#8212;isn't allowed
to carry classified data, nobody paid much attention to its
security.</p>

<p>"You ought to be talking to the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations," she said. "They're the narcs of the Air Force. Drug
busts and murders. Not exactly white-collar crime, but it can't hurt
to talk to them. I'm sorry I can't help you, but it's really not my
bailiwick."</p>

<p>Three phone calls later, I'm in a conference call with Special
Agent Jim Christy of the AFOSI and Major Steve Rudd of the Defense
Communications Agency.</p>

<p>Jim Christy made me nervous&#8212;he sounded like a narc. "Let me
get this straight. Some hacker broke into your computer, then got into
an Army computer in Alabama, and is now going for White Sands Missile
Range?"<a id="p67" name="p67"></a></p>

<p>"Yes, that's about what we've seen." I didn't want to explain the
Unix Gnu-Emacs security hole. "Our traces aren't complete yet; he
might be from California, Alabama, Virginia, or maybe New Jersey."</p>

<p>"Oh . . . you're not shutting him out so that you can catch the
bastard." He was ahead of me.</p>

<p>"And if we close him out, he'll just enter the Internet through
some other hole."</p>

<p>Steve Rudd, on the other hand, wanted the hacker nailed. "We can't
let this continue. Even without classified information, the Milnet's
integrity demands that spies be kept out."</p>

<p>Spies? My ears pricked up.</p>

<p>The narc spoke next. "I don't suppose the FBI has lifted a
finger."</p>

<p>I summarized our five calls to the FBI in one word.</p>

<p>Almost apologetically, Jim Christy told me, "The FBI isn't required
to investigate every crime. Probably they look at one in
five. Computer crimes aren't easy&#8212;not like kidnapping or bank
robbery, where there's witnesses and obvious losses. Don't blame them
for shying away from a tough case with no clear solution."</p>

<p>Steve pressed Jim. "OK, so the FBI won't do anything. How about
AFOSI?"</p>

<p>Jim answered slowly, "We're the Air Force computer crime
investigators. We usually hear about computer crimes only after a
loss. This is the first one that we've come across in progress."</p>

<p>Steve cut in, "Jim, you're a special agent. The only difference
between you and an FBI agent is your jurisdiction. Doesn't this fall
in your court?"</p>

<p>"It does. It's a strange case that falls in several courts." Over
the phone, I could almost hear Jim think. "We're interested, all
right. I can't tell if this is a serious problem or a red herring, but
it's well worth investigating."</p>

<p>Jim continued, "Look, Cliff. Each agency has thresholds. Our
resources are finite so we're forced to choose what we
investigate. That's why the FBI asked you about the dollar
loss&#8212;they're looking to get the most bang for their effort. Now
if classified stuff gets stolen, it's a different story. National
security doesn't equate to dollars."<a id="p68" name="p68"></a></p>

<p>Steve interrupted, "But unclassified information can also equate to
national security. The problem is convincing law enforcement
people."</p>

<p>"So what'll you do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Right now, there's really not much we can do. If this hacker's
using the military networks, though, he's walking on our
territory. Keep us informed and we'll sharpen our stingers."</p>

<p>In hopes of encouraging AFOSI, I sent Jim a copy of my logbook, and
samples of the hacker's printouts.</p>

<p>After this conversation, Jim Christy explained about the
Milnet. What I called the Milnet, Jim knew as the unclassified Defense
Data Network, run by the Defense Communications Agency. "The
Department of Defense runs the Milnet for all the services&#8212;Army,
Navy, Air Force, and Marines. That way, each service has equal access
to the network, and you'll find computers from every branch on the
net."</p>

<p>"So why is Steve Rudd in the Air Force?"</p>

<p>"He's really a purple-suiter&#8212;he works for all three
branches. Naturally, when he smelled a problem, he called the Air
Force investigators."</p>

<p>"And you work full time on computer crime?"</p>

<p>"You betcha. We're watching ten thousand Air Force computers."</p>

<p>"Then why can't you wrap up this case in a snap?"</p>

<p>Jim spoke slowly. "We've got to clearly define our
territory. Unless we do, we step on each other's toes. You, Cliff,
have no worries that you'll be busted by the OSI&#8212;our bailiwick
is the Air Force base."</p>

<p>Bailiwicks always belong to someone else.</p>

<p>You know, much as I complained about bailiwicks, I realized that
they protected my own rights: our constitution prevents the military
from grubbing around civilian affairs. Jim had put this into a new
light&#8212;sometimes these rights actually do interfere with law
enforcement. For the first time, I realized that my civil rights
actually limit what police can do.</p>

<p>Whoops. I'd forgotten the boss's instructions to call White
Sands. Another few minutes on the phone, and I reached Chris McDonald,
a civilian working for the missile range.</p>

<p>I outlined the case&#8212;Unix, Tymnet, Oakland, Milnet, Anniston,
AFOSI, FBI.<a id="p69" name="p69"></a></p>

<p>Chris interrupted, "Did you say Anniston?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the hacker was super-user at Anniston Army Depot. It's a
little place in Alabama, I think."</p>

<p>"I know Anniston, all right. They're our sister Army base. After we
test our missiles, we ship 'em off to Anniston," Chris said. "And
their computers come from White Sands as well."</p>

<p>I wondered if this was just coincidence. Perhaps the hacker had
read data in the Anniston computers, and realized that the good stuff
came from White Sands. Maybe the hacker was sampling every site where
the Army stored missiles.</p>

<p>Or maybe the hacker had a list of computers with security
holes. "Say, Chris, do you have Gnu-Emacs on your computers?"</p>

<p>Chris didn't know, but he'd ask around. But to exploit that hole,
the hacker had to log in first. And the hacker had failed, after
trying four times on each of five computers.</p>

<p>White Sands kept their doors locked by forcing everyone on their
computers to use long passwords, and to change them every four
months. A technician wasn't allowed to choose her own
password&#8212;the computer assigned unguessable passwords, like
"agnitfom" or "nietoayx." Every account had a password, and none could
be guessed.</p>

<p>I didn't like the White Sands system. I couldn't remember
computer-generated passwords, so I'd write them in my wallet or next
to my terminal. Much better to allow people to choose their own
passwords. Sure, some people would pick guessable passwords, like
their names. But at least they wouldn't complain about having to
memorize some nonsense word like "tremvonk," and they wouldn't write
them down.</p>

<p>But the hacker got into my system and was rebuffed at White
Sands. Maybe random passwords, obnoxious and dissonant, are more
secure. I don't know.</p>

<p>I'd followed the boss's orders. The FBI didn't care about us, but
the Air Force sleuths were on the case. And I'd notified White Sands
that someone was trying to break in. Satisfied, I met Martha at a
vegetarian pizza stand. Over slices of thick-crust spinach and pesto,
I described the day's events.<a id="p70" name="p70"></a></p>

<p>"Vell, Natasha, we have accomplished mission one."</p>

<p>"Vonderful, Boris, vhat a victory. Boris . . . vhat is mission
one?"</p>

<p>"We have made rendezvous vith ze secret air force police,
Natasha."</p>

<p>"Yes, Boris?"</p>

<p>"Ve have alerted ze missile base to ze counter-counter-intelligence
efforts."</p>

<p>"Yes, Boris?"</p>

<p>"And we have ordered ze secret spy pizza."</p>

<p>"But Boris, ven do we catch ze spy?"</p>

<p>"Patience, Natasha. Zat is mission two."</p>

<p>It wasn't until we started walking home that we got to the serious
side of our game.</p>

<p>"This thing is getting weirder and weirder," Martha said. "It
started out as a hobby, chasing some local prankster, and now you're
talking to these military people who wear suits and have no sense of
humor. Cliff, they're not your type."</p>

<p>I defended myself stuffily. "This is a harmless and possibly
beneficial project to keep them busy. After all, this is what they're
supposed to be doing&#8212;keeping the bad guys out."</p>

<p>Martha wouldn't let that sit. "Yeah, but what about you,
Cliff. What are you doing hanging out with these people? I understand
that you have to at least talk to them, but how deeply are you getting
involved?"</p>

<p>"Every step makes perfect sense from my point of view," I
said. "I'm a system manager trying to protect my computer. If someone
hacks into it, I have to chase him. To ignore the bastard will let him
wreck other systems. Yes, I'm cooperating with the Air Force police,
but that doesn't mean I approve of everything the military stands
for."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you have to decide how you want to live your life,"
Martha said. "Do you want to spend your time being a cop?"</p>

<p>"A cop? No, I'm an astronomer. But here's someone threatening to
destroy our work."</p>

<p>"We don't know that," Martha retorted. "Maybe this hacker is closer
to us politically than those security people. What if you're chasing
someone on your own side? Perhaps<a id="p71" name="p71"></a> he's
trying to expose problems of military proliferation. Some sort of
electronic civil disobedience."</p>

<p>My own political views hadn't evolved much from the late 1960s
... a sort of fuzzy, mixed bag of the new-left. I'd never thought much
about politics, feeling that I was a harmless non-ideologue, trying to
avoid unpleasant political commitments. I resisted radical left-wing
dogma, but I sure wasn't a conservative. I had no desire to buddy up
with the feds. Yet here I was, walking side by side with the military
police.</p>

<p>"About the only way to find out who's at the other end is to trace
the wires," I said. "These organizations may not be our favorites, but
the particular actions that we're cooperating over aren't bad. It's
not like I'm running guns to the Contras."</p>

<p>"Just watch your step."</p>

<h3>13</h3>

<p class="first">My three weeks were almost up. If I didn't catch the
hacker within twenty-four hours, the lab would shut down my tracking
operation. I camped out in the switchyard, jumping at every
connection. "Come into my parlor," said the spider to the fly.</p>

<p>Sure enough, at 2:30 in the afternoon, the printer advanced a page,
and the hacker logged in. Although this time he used the stolen
account, <em>Goran,</em> I didn't doubt that it was the hacker: he
immediately checked who was on the computer. Finding no operator
present, he searched out the Gnu-Emacs security hole, and started his
delicate minuet to become super-user.</p>

<p>I didn't watch. A minute after the hacker connected, I called Ron
Vivier at Tymnet and Lee Cheng at the phone company. I took notes as
Ron mumbled, "He's coming into your port 14, and entering Tymnet from
Oakland. It's our port 322 which is, uh, let me see here." I could
hear him tapping his keyboard. "Yeah, it's 2902. 430-2902. That's the
number to trace."<a id="p72" name="p72"></a></p>

<p>Lee Cheng popped on the phone line. "Right. I'm tracing it." More
keytaps, this time with a few beeps thrown in. "That line is live, all
right. And it's coming from AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T in Virginia. Hold on,
I'll call New Jersey."</p>

<p>I listened in as Lee talked with some AT&amp;T guy named Edsel (or
was it Ed Sell?) in Whippany, New Jersey. Apparently, all of
AT&amp;T's long-distance phone lines are traced through New
Jersey. Without understanding the jargon, I transcribed what I
heard. "Routing 5095, no that's 5096MCLN."</p>

<p>Another technician's voice broke in. "I'll call McLean."</p>

<p>The New Jersey technician came back. "Yeah. 5096 terminates in 703
land."</p>

<p>There were suddenly six people on the line. The phone company's
conference calls were crisp and loud. The newest member of the
conference call was a woman with a slight drawl. "Y'all are trunked
into McLean, and it's almost dinnertime here at C and P."</p>

<p>Lee's clipped voice interrupted her. "Emergency trace on routing
code 5096MCLN, your termination line 427."</p>

<p>"I copy 5096MCLN line 427. I'm tracing right now."</p>

<p>Silence for a minute, then she came back on line. "Here it comes,
boys. Hey, it looks like it's from 415 territory."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Greetings from San Francisco Bay," Lee slid in.</p>

<p>She spoke to no one in particular. "Trunk group 5096MCLN, routing
427 winds up in 448. Our ESS4 at 448. Is it a PBX?" She answered her
own question: "No, it's a rotary. Frame twenty-four. I'm almost at the
tip ring sleeve. Here we are. Five hundred pair cable, group three
number twelve . . . that's ten, uh, ten sixty. You want me to confirm
with a short drop-out?"</p>

<p>Lee interpreted her jargon. "She's completed the trace. To make
sure that she's traced the right number, she wants to turn off the
connection for a second. If she does that, it'll hang up the line. Is
that OK?"</p>

<p>The hacker was in the midst of reading some electronic mail. I
doubted that he'd miss a few characters. "Sure. Tell her to go ahead,
and I'll see what happens here."</p>

<p>Lee talked with her a bit, and announced with certainty, "Stand
by." He explained that each telephone line has a set of fuses in the
central switching office; they protect the<a id="p73" name="p73"></a>
equipment from lightning and idiots that plug their phone lines into
power outlets. The central office technician can go to the cable room
and pull the line's fuse, forcing it to hang up. It wasn't necessary,
but it double checked their tracing efforts.</p>

<p>In a minute, the central office tech came onto the line and said,
"I'm popping the fuse . . . now." Sure enough, the hacker dropped off,
right in the middle of a command. They'd traced the right line.</p>

<p>The woman's voice came on. "It's 1060, all right. That's all,
boys. I'll shuffle some tissues and ship it on upstairs."</p>

<p>Lee thanked everyone, and I heard the conference call clear. "The
trace is complete and the technician's writing it up. As soon as I get
the trace data, I'll give it to the police."</p>

<p>I didn't understand. Why didn't he just tell me the owner of the
phone?</p>

<p>Lee explained that the telephone company dealt with the police, not
with individuals. Moreover, he didn't know where the line had been
traced to. The tech that completed the trace would fill out the proper
papers (aah! "shuffling tissues") and release them to the
authorities.</p>

<p>I protested, "Can't you just short-circuit the bureaucracy and tell
me who the hacker is?"</p>

<p>No. First, Lee didn't have the trace information. The technician in
Virginia did. Until the Virginia phone company released it, Lee knew
as little as I did.</p>

<p>Lee pointed out another problem: my search warrant was only valid
in California. A California court couldn't compel the Virginia
telephone company to turn over evidence. We'd need either a Virginia
or Federal court order.</p>

<p>I protested, "The FBI's turned us down five times already. And the
guy's probably not breaking any Virginia law. Look, can't you give me
the phone number on the side and just wink?"</p>

<p>Lee didn't know. He'd call Virginia and try to convince them to
give us the information, but he didn't hold out much hope. Damn. At
the other end of the phone line, someone was breaking into military
computers, and we couldn't even get his phone number, ten seconds
after the line was traced.<a id="p74" name="p74"></a></p>

<p>The phone trace was complete, though not quite successful. How do
we get a Virginia search warrant? My boss, Roy Kerth, was gone for the
next couple weeks, so I called the lab's lawyer directly. To my
surprise, Aletha paid serious attention to the problem. She'd rattle
the FBI again, and see whether we had a case in Virginia. I warned her
that, as a peon, I had no authority to even be talking to her, let
alone asking for legal services. She reassured me, "Don't be
silly. This is more fun than worrying about patent law."</p>

<p>The laboratory police wanted to know all about the phone trace. I
told them to prepare to stake out the entire state of
Virginia. Despite my cynicism, they were surprisingly sympathetic to
my problem with the Virginia search warrant, and offered to use their
old-boy-network to get the information through some informal
channel. I doubted it would work, but why not let them try?</p>

<p class="first">The phone company might conceal the hacker's phone
number, but my printers showed his every move. While I talked to
Tymnet and the telephone techs, the hacker had prowled through my
computer. He wasn't satisfied reading the system manager's mail; he
also snooped through mail for several nuclear physicists.</p>

<p>After fifteen minutes of reading our mail, he jumped back into
Goran's stolen account, using his new password, <em>Benson.</em> He
started a program that searched our user's files for passwords; while
that executed, he called up the Milnet Network Information
Center. Again, he knew who he was looking for:</p>

<p>He had asked for the pathway into the CIA. But instead of their
computer, he found four people who worked at the CIA.</p>

<p>Whee! I pictured all these CIA spies playing cloak-and-dagger;
meanwhile, someone's pushing on their back door.</p>

<p>So I asked myself, "Should I tell them?"</p>

<p>"No. Why waste my time telling them? Let some spy run around in the
CIA's backyard. See if I care. My three weeks of chasing the hacker
are up. It's about time to shut our doors and work on real problems of
physics and astronomy. He's someone else's problem now."</p>

<p>And yet it didn't feel right. The hacker walked through military
computers, yet nobody noticed. The CIA didn't know. The FBI didn't
care. Who would pick up where we left off?</p>

<p>I reached for the telephone to call the people listed in the CIA,
then put it down. What's a long-haired hippie doing calling some
spooks? What would Martha say?</p>

<p>Well, whose side was I on? Not the CIA's, for sure. But then, I
wasn't rooting for someone to break in there, either. At least I
didn't think so.</p>

<p>Foo. The jerk was trying to slither into someone's computer. Nobody
else will warn them, so I'd better. I'm not responsible for the CIA's
actions, only my own.</p>

<p>Before I could change my mind again, I called the first CIA guy's
phone number. No answer. The second guy was on vacation&#8212;his
answering machine said so. The third person . . .<a id="p76"
name="p76"></a></p>

<p>A business voice answered, "Extension 6161."</p>

<p>I stammered a bit. "Urn, hello, I'm looking for Ed Manning."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>I didn't know where to begin. How do you introduce yourself to a
spy? "Uh, you don't know me, but I'm a computer manager, and we've
been following a computer hacker."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh."</p>

<p>"Well, he searched for a pathway to try to get into the CIA's
computers. Instead, he found your name and phone number. I'm not sure
what this means, but someone's looking for you. Or maybe they're just
looking for the CIA and stumbled on your name." I'm floundering,
scared of the guy I'm talking to.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>Nervously, I told him, expecting him to send over a gang of hit men
in trench coats. I described our laboratory, making sure he understood
that the People's Republic of Berkeley didn't have official diplomatic
relations with his organization.</p>

<p>"Can I send someone over tomorrow? No, that's Saturday. How about
Monday afternoon?"</p>

<p>Uh oh. The hit men were on their way. I tried to backpedal. "This
probably isn't serious. The guy didn't find anything except four
names. You don't have to worry about him getting into your
computer."</p>

<p>Mr. Manning wasn't convinced. "I know why my name's listed. Last
year I worked on some computers at the Ballistics Research Lab. But
we're professionally interested in this, and we'd appreciate a chance
to learn more. Conceivably, this might be a serious problem."</p>

<p>Who was I talking to? Weren't these the people who meddle in
Central American politics and smuggle arms to right-wing thugs? Yet
the guy I'd just talked to didn't sound like a villain. He seemed like
an ordinary person concerned with a problem.</p>

<p>And why not set them on the trail of someone just as meddlesome and
destructive as I always thought <em>they</em> were? Tracking down a
real wrongdoer would give the CIA<a id="p77" name="p77"></a> something
harmless, perhaps even beneficial, to do&#8212;keep them out of
trouble.</p>

<p>It was no use arguing. They needed to know, and I couldn't see a
good reason to avoid telling them. And talking to the CIA wouldn't
hurt anyone&#8212;it wasn't like shipping guns to a military
dictator. After all, isn't this what they're legitimately supposed to
do: protect us from bad guys? If I don't tell them what's happening,
who will?</p>

<p>I couldn't help comparing the CIA's immediate reaction with the
response I got from the FBI. Six calls for help, and a half dozen
responses, "Go away, kid."</p>

<p>Well, I agreed to meet with his agents, provided they didn't wear
trench coats.</p>

<p>"Now I've put my foot in it," I thought. "Not only am I talking to
the CIA, but I'm inviting them up to Berkeley. What'll I tell my
radical friends?"</p>

<h3>15</h3>

<p class="first">Windmill Quarry is just across the Niagara River from
Buffalo, New York, where I grew up. It's a ten-mile bicycle ride,
across the Peace Bridge to Canada and down a few winding roads to the
finest swimming hole around. If you dodge the potholes and speak
politely to the U.S. and Canadian customs agents, you'll have no
problems.</p>

<p>High school had just let out in June of 1968 when I biked over to
Windmill Quarry for a Saturday swim. Two other friends and I wore
ourselves out trying to swim to the raft in the middle of the
water. Around six, we ran out of steam, hopped on our bikes, and
headed back to Buffalo.</p>

<p>Three miles shy of the Peace Bridge, we were pedaling along the
stony margins of a country road when a pickup truck crowded us off the
roadside. Someone swore at us and tossed a half-empty can of Genessee
beer, hitting our lead rider. She wasn't hurt but all three of us were
furious.<a id="p78" name="p78"></a></p>

<p>We were on our bikes. No way to catch up with the SOBs. Even if we
could, what would we do? We were three miles inside of Canada, after
all. We were powerless, unable to retaliate.</p>

<p>But I'd caught a glimpse of the license plate. From New York
State. Oh ... they're returning to Buffalo, too. Then it hit me.</p>

<p>I stopped at the first phone booth&#8212;luckily there was a
directory&#8212;and called the U.S. customs agents. "There's a green
Chevy pickup truck heading for the Peace Bridge," I reported. "I'm not
sure, but I think they're carrying some drugs." The agent thanked me,
and I hung up.</p>

<p>The three of us biked back at a leisurely pace. We got to the
bottom of the bridge, looked over at the side of the road . . . and my
heart sang! Sure enough, there was that green pickup, hood up, seat
pulled out, and two wheels removed. Customs agents were crawling all
over it, searching for drugs.</p>

<p>Aah. The sense of recovered dignity.</p>

<p>Years ago, I hadn't asked that clown to throw a beer can at us. Nor
today had I asked this hacker to invade my computer. I didn't want to
track him around the networks. I'd rather be doing astronomy.</p>

<p>But now that I'd evolved a strategy, I could only follow the hacker
by being sneaky and tenacious. And by informing the few authorities
that seemed to care. Like the CIA.</p>

<p>Roy was on vacation, so not only couldn't he tell me to drop the
investigation now that my three weeks were up, but he couldn't say
anything about the CIA visiting. His stand-in, Dennis Hall, was to
greet the spooks.</p>

<p>Dennis is a tranquil, introspective Zen master whose job is to link
small computers to Cray supercomputers. He sees networks as channels
to slosh computing power from laboratories to desktops. Little
computers should talk to people; leave the number crunching to the
mainframes. If your desktop workstation's too slow, then move the hard
work into a bigger computer.</p>

<p>In a sense, Dennis is the enemy of computer centers. He wants
people to use computers without the mumbo jumbo<a id="p79"
name="p79"></a> of programming. As long as there are software wizards
and gurus, Dennis won't be satisfied with the distribution of
computing power.</p>

<p>His is a world of ethernets, optical fibers, and satellite
links. Other computer folks measure size in megabytes of memory, and
speed in megaflops&#8212;millions of floating-point-operations per
second. To Dennis, size is measured by counting computers on your
network; speed is measured in megabytes per second&#8212;how fast the
computers talk to each other. The system isn't the computer, it's the
network.</p>

<p>Dennis saw the hacker problem in terms of social morality. "We'll
always find a few dodos poking around our data. I'm worried about how
hackers poison the trust that's built our networks. After years of
trying to hook together a bunch of computers, a few morons can spoil
everything."</p>

<p>I didn't see how trust had anything to do with it. "Networks are
little more than cables and wires," I said.</p>

<p>"And an interstate highway is just concrete, asphalt, and bridges?"
Dennis replied. "You're seeing the crude physical apparatus&#8212;the
wires and communications. The real work isn't laying wires, it's
agreeing to link isolated communities together. It's figuring out
who's going to pay for the maintenance and improvements. It's forging
alliances between groups that don't trust each other."</p>

<p>"Like the military and universities, huh?" I said, thinking of the
Internet.</p>

<p>"Yes, and more. The agreements are informal and the networks are
overloaded," Dennis said. "Our software is fragile as well&#8212;if
people built houses the way we write programs, the first woodpecker
would wipe out civilization."</p>

<p>With the CIA due in ten minutes, Dennis and I talked about what to
say. I had no idea what they wanted, other than a listing of last
Friday's activity. I could imagine them: some secret agent looking
like James Bond, or a hit man specializing in rubouts. Of course
there'd be Mr. Big behind them all, pulling the puppet strings. They'd
all be in dark glasses and trench coats.<a id="p80"
name="p80"></a></p>

<p>Dennis gave me instructions. "Cliff, tell them what we know, but
don't speculate. Confine yourself to facts."</p>

<p>" 'S'all reet. But suppose there's a hit man with 'em, who wants to
rub me out because I found that they're spying on the military?"</p>

<p>"Be serious." Everyone told me to be serious. "And for once, be
polite. They've got enough problems without a raving Berkeley
longhair. And skip the yo-yo tricks."</p>

<p>"Yes, Daddy. I'll be good. I promise."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about them. They're like anyone else around here,
except a bit more paranoid."</p>

<p>"And a bit more Republican," I added.</p>

<p>OK, so they didn't wear trench coats. Not even sunglasses. Instead,
boring suits and ties. I should have warned them to dress like the
natives: beat-up dungarees and flannel shirts.</p>

<p>Wayne saw the four of them walk up the drive and flashed a message
to my terminal: "All hands on deck. Sales reps approach through
starboard portal. Charcoal-gray suits. Set warp speed to avoid IBM
sales pitch." If only he knew.</p>

<p>The four spooks introduced themselves. One guy in his fifties said
he was there as a driver, and didn't give his name&#8212;he just sat
there quietly the whole time. The second spy, Greg Fennel, I guessed
to be a computer jockey, because he seemed uncomfortable in a
suit.</p>

<p>The third agent was built like a halfback. Teejay didn't give his
last name&#8212;or did he conceal his first name? If anyone was the
hit man, Teejay was. The fourth guy must be the bigwig: everyone shut
up when he talked. Together, they looked more like bureaucrats than
spies.</p>

<p>The four of them sat quietly while Dennis gave them an overview of
what we'd seen. No questions. I walked to the chalkboard and drew a
diagram:<a id="p81" name="p81"></a></p>

<center><img src="CuckooFlow120.png" /></center>

<br />
 
<p>Greg Fennel wouldn't let me get away with just a drawing. "Prove
the connection from the phone company to Tymnet."</p>

<p>I described the phone trace and the conference calls to Ron
Vivier.</p>

<p>"Since he's not erasing anything, how did you detect him?"</p>

<p>"A hiccup in our accounting system; you see, he imbalanced our
accounts when he . . ."</p>

<p>Greg interrupted, "So he's super-user on your Unix system? Bad
news, huh?" Greg seemed to be a sharp systems guy. I figured I might
as well go into detail.</p>

<p>"It's a bug in the Gnu-Emacs editor. Its mail utility runs with
root privilege." Technical questions were easy.</p>

<p>We talked Unix for a bit, and Mr. Big started playing with his
pencil. "Can you give us a profile of this guy? How old is he? What's
his level of expertise?"</p>

<p>Tougher question. "Well, we've only watched him for three weeks, so
it's hard to say. He's accustomed to AT&amp;T Unix, so he's not from
around Berkeley. Perhaps he's a high school student. He's paranoid,
always looking over his shoulder, yet patient, and not very
creative."</p>

<p>"Does he know English?"</p>

<p>"Well, we think that he once sent mail to our system manager,
saying, 'Hello.' After sending that message, he never again used that
account."</p>

<p>Teejay, silent until now, asked, "Is he recording his
sessions?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell for certain, but I think that he's keeping a
notebook. At the very least, he's got a good memory."</p>

<p>Mr. Big nodded and asked, "What keywords has he scanned for?"</p>

<p>"He looks for words like <em>password, nuclear, SDI,</em>
and <em>Norad.</em> He's picked some curious
passwords&#8212;<em>lblhack, hedges, jaeger, hunter,</em>
and <em>benson.</em> The accounts he stole, <em>Goran, Sventek,
Whitberg,</em> and <em>Mark,</em> don't say much about him because
they are names of people here at the laboratory."</p>

<p>Teejay suddenly lit up. He passed a note to Greg. Greg passed it on
to Mr. Big, who nodded and asked, "Tell me what did he do at
Anniston?"</p>

<p>"I don't have much of a printout there," I said. "He was into their
system for several months, perhaps as long as a<a id="p83"
name="p83"></a> year. Now, since he knows they've detected him, he
logs in only for a moment."</p>

<p>Mr. Big fidgeted a bit, meaning that the meeting was about to break
up. Greg asked one more question: "What machines has he attacked?"</p>

<p>"Ours, of course, and the Army base in Anniston. He's tried to get
into White Sands Missile Range, and some Navy shipyard in Maryland. I
think it's called Dockmaster."</p>

<p>"Shit!" Greg and Teejay simultaneously exclaimed. Mr. Big looked at
them quizzically. Greg said, "How do you know he hit Dockmaster?"</p>

<p>"About the same time he screwed up our accounting, this Dockmaster
place sent us a message saying that someone had tried to break in
there." I didn't know what the big deal was.</p>

<p>"Did he succeed?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. What is this Dockmaster place, anyway? Aren't
they some Navy shipyard?"</p>

<p>They whispered among themselves, and Mr. Big nodded. Greg
explained, "Dockmaster isn't a Navy shipyard. It's run by the National
Security Agency."</p>

<p>A hacker breaking into NSA? Bizarre. This guy wanted to get into
the CIA, the NSA, Army missile bases, and the North American Air
Defense headquarters.</p>

<p>I knew a little about the NSA. They're the secret electronics
spooks that listen in on foreign radio broadcasts. They launch
satellites to listen to Soviet telephone calls. I'd heard (and didn't
believe) rumors that they record every overseas phone call and
telegram.</p>

<p>Greg explained from his standpoint. "Most of NSA works on
collecting and analyzing signals from abroad. One section, however,
works on protecting information belonging to the United States."</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said, "like making ciphers that you think the Commies
can't break." Dennis shot me a glance and silently mouthed the word
"Polite."</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah," Greg said, "that group worries about computer
security. They run the Dockmaster computer."</p>

<p>"Sounds like Janus, the two-faced god," I said. "One side tries to
crack ciphers of foreign countries; the other side tries to make
unbreakable codes. Always pulling in opposite directions."<a id="p84"
name="p84"></a></p>

<p>"Sorta like our own agency," Greg looked around nervously. "We're
known for dirty tricks, but we're fundamentally a news
organization. Most of our work is just gathering and analyzing
information, yet try saying that on campus." Greg rolled his
eyes. He'd paid his dues as a college recruiter. Hard to say why, but
this spy seemed reasonable. Not arrogant, but sensitive and aware. If
we must poke around in dark corners, I'd be more comfortable with him
in charge.</p>

<p>"Well then, why can I reach NSA's computers from my unclassified
and obviously insecure computer?" If I could reach out and touch NSA,
then they could touch me.</p>

<p>"Dockmaster is NSA's only unclassified computer," Greg said. "It
belongs to their computer security group, which is actually
public."</p>

<p>Mr. Big started talking slowly. "There's not much we can do about
this affair. I think there's no evidence of foreign espionage. Agents
on assignment don't send notes to adversaries."</p>

<p>"Well, who should be working on this case?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The FBI. I'm sorry, but this isn't our bailiwick. Our entire
involvement has been the exposure of four names&#8212; names that are
already in the public domain, I might add."</p>

<p>On the way out, I showed our Vax computers to Greg and
Teejay. Between rows of disk drives, Greg said, "This is the most
serious hacker problem I've heard of. Despite what the boss says,
could you keep me informed?"</p>

<p>I decided to trust this guy. "Sure. Want a copy of my logbook?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Send me anything. Even if the agency can't do anything, we
need to become aware of this type of threat."</p>

<p>"Why? Do spooks have computers?"</p>

<p>Greg looked at Teejay and laughed. "We've lost count. Our building
floats on computers."</p>

<p>"What would the CIA use computers for? Can you overthrow foreign
governments with software?" Dennis wasn't around to tell me to be
polite.</p>

<p>"Stop thinking that we're arch villains and think of us instead as
information gatherers. The information's worthless until it's
correlated, analyzed, and summarized. That alone is a lot of word
processing."<a id="p85" name="p85"></a></p>

<p>"Personal computer stuff, I'll bet."</p>

<p>"No, not if you want to do it right. We're trying to avoid the next
Pearl Harbor, and that means getting information to the right person
fast. Right off, that says networks and computers. To analyze and
predict the actions of foreign governments, we use computer-based
models. Again, big computers. Nowadays, everything from economic
forecasts to image processing requires powerful number crunchers."</p>

<p>I'd never thought of the CIA as needing really major
computers. "How do you keep your systems secure?"</p>

<p>"Strict isolation. There's no wires connecting to the outside."</p>

<p>"Can any CIA agent read anyone else's files?"</p>

<p>Greg laughed, but Teejay didn't. "No way. In our world, everyone's
compartmentalized. So if one person turns out to be, how should I say,
less than trustworthy, the amount of damage is limited."</p>

<p>"Then how do you keep people from reading each other's files?"</p>

<p>"We use trusted operating systems. Computers with thick walls
between each individual's data. If you want to read someone else's
files, then you've got to get permission. Teejay can tell you some
horror stories."</p>

<p>Teejay looked sideways at Greg. Greg said, "Go ahead, Teejay. It's
already public."</p>

<p>"Two years ago, one of our contractors built a centralized terminal
switchbox," Teejay said. "We needed to interconnect a few thousand
terminals to some of our computers."</p>

<p>"Oh, like my lab's switchyard."</p>

<p>"Multiply your switchyard by fifty, and you have some idea."</p>

<p>Teejay continued, "Each employee of this contractor had to pass the
same tests as our regular employees&#8212;compartmentalized top
secret.</p>

<p>"Well, one of our secretaries went on vacation for a month. When
she returned and logged onto her computer, she noticed that her
account had been accessed a week earlier. You see, every time you sign
onto our computers, it shows the date when you last logged on.</p>

<p>"We started sniffing around. The SOB that had connected the
terminals wiretapped them from our computer<a id="p86" name="p86"></a>
room. He'd capture passwords and text, and then pry into our password
disks."</p>

<p>I knew how easy it was to watch the traffic in the LBL
switchyard. "Did you bump him off?" I asked, imagining some midnight
action with a silenced gun.</p>

<p>Teejay looked at me strangely. "Be serious. Where we come from,
it's 'In God we trust, all others we polygraph.' "</p>

<p>Greg finished the story. "We wired him to a lie detector for a
week, and the FBI indicted him. It'll be a long time before he sees
sunlight."</p>

<p>Walking out of the lab, I asked Teejay, "Looks like the CIA's not
going to do much for me, huh?"</p>

<p>"If my superior doesn't think it's serious, there's not much we can
do. Ed Manning has the power to make something happen."</p>

<p>"Huh? I thought Ed Manning was a programmer?"</p>

<p>"Hardly. He's director of information technology. When you called
him, you hit a central nerve."</p>

<p>A director who knew his way around the networks? Now that's a rare
organization. No wonder they flew four people out here. There's a
bigger Mr. Big back at the headquarters.</p>

<p>"So when you report that there's nothing shaking here, you'll drop
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's not much that we can do," Greg said. "It's the FBI's
territory."</p>

<p>"Any chance you can rattle their cages and ask them to
investigate?"</p>

<p>"I'll try, but don't expect much. The FBI likes to chase bank
robbers and kidnappers. Computer crime, well, let's say they've got
other worries."</p>

<p>"What I hear you saying is, 'Stop watching and zipper things up.'
"</p>

<p>"Not quite. You're watching an extensive attack on our
networks. Someone's going after the very heart of our information
systems. We've expected minor attacks for several years, but I've
never heard of anything this far-reaching. The convoluted connections,
the single-minded search for sensitive targets ... it points to an
adversary who's determined to get into our computers. If you close
your doors, he'll just find another way in."</p>

<p>"So you're saying, 'Stay open and keep monitoring' even though the
FBI ignores us."<a id="p87" name="p87"></a></p>

<p>Greg looked at Teejay. "I can't buck my management. But you're
doing an important piece of, well, research. The FBI will eventually
wake up. Until then, keep at it."</p>

<p>I was astonished&#8212;these guys saw the severity of the situation
but couldn't do anything. Or were they just saying that?</p>

<p>Encouraging words from the CIA.</p>

<h3>16</h3>

<p class="first">It would have been a fun show for the spooks if the
hacker appeared while they were visiting. Instead he showed up the
next morning at 9:10. Once again we started the traces through Tymnet
and the phone company; once again we struck a brick wall somewhere in
Virginia. If only our California search warrant were good in Virginia
. . .</p>

<p>That day the hacker seemed confident, even arrogant. He performed
his usual tricks: checking who's on the system, sneaking through the
hole in our operating system, listing electronic mail. In the past he
made occasional mistakes as he tried new commands. Today he used no
new commands. He was smooth, determined. No mistakes.</p>

<p>As if he were showing off.</p>

<p>He went straight for the Anniston Army Depot and printed out a
short file about the combat readiness of Army missiles. He then tried
the Army's Ballistic Research Lab's computers in Aberdeen,
Maryland. The Milnet took only a second to connect, but BRL's
passwords defeated him: he couldn't get through.</p>

<p>He wasted the rest of my morning by raking through my scientists'
files, searching for passwords. In a physicist's area, he found one:
an old file that described the way to get into a Cray supercomputer at
Lawrence Livermore Labs.</p>

<p>To keep people from guessing passwords into their supercomputer,
Livermore also used random computer-generated passwords,
like <em>agnitfom</em> or <em>ngagk.</em> Naturally, nobody can
remember these passwords. Result? Some people save their passwords in
computer files. What good is a combination lock when the combination's
scribbled on the wall?<a id="p88" name="p88"></a></p>

<p>Dave Cleveland, our Unix Guru, watched the hacker. "At least he
can't get into the classified computers at Livermore," Dave said.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Their classified system is completely off net. It's isolated."</p>

<p>"Then what's the password lead to?"</p>

<p>"Livermore has a few unclassified computers, where they research
fusion energy."</p>

<p>"Sounds like bomb making to me," I said. Any kind of fusion seemed
like bomb making.</p>

<p>"They're trying to build fusion energy reactors to generate cheap
electricity. You know, fusion reactions inside donut-shaped magnetic
fields."</p>

<p>"Sure. I played with one when I was a kid."</p>

<p>"I thought so. Since it's not weapons research, that computer's
accessible from networks."</p>

<p>"We'd better warn Livermore to disable that account."</p>

<p>"Just wait. You can't reach the Magnetic Fusion Energy computer
from here. Your hacker friend's going to wear himself out trying."</p>

<p>"Uh, the ranger's not gonna like this, Yogi ..."</p>

<p>"Trust me."</p>

<p>The hacker stayed around for a few more minutes, then
disconnected. Never even tried to get into Livermore.</p>

<p>"So much for that theory," Dave shrugged.</p>

<p>In hopes that they might be used as evidence, Dave and I signed the
printouts. We left the printers in the switchyard and I wandered back
to my office. Within an hour my terminal beeped: the hacker was
back.</p>

<p>But none of the printers showed him. Checking the Unix systems, I
saw him, logged in as Sventek. But he wasn't entering through our
Tymnet ports!</p>

<p>Quickly, I scanned the dial-in modems. Two scientists editing
programs, a bureaucrat listing boilerplate from a contract, and a
student writing a love letter. No obvious hacking.</p>

<p>I ran back to my office and glanced at the Unix computer's
status. Sventek, all right. But coming from where?</p>

<p>There: the hacker's port wasn't an ordinary 1200-baud line. That's
why he didn't show up in the switchyard. No,<a id="p89"
name="p89"></a> he was coming from our local network. Our
ethernet. The green cable that interconnected a hundred terminals and
workstations around our laboratory.</p>

<p>I ran to Wayne's office. "Look&#8212;the hacker's on our local area
network."</p>

<p>"Slow down, Cliff. Lemme see." Wayne kept five terminals in his
office, each watching a different system. "Yeah, there's Sventek, on
the Unix-4 computer. Whatcha wanna do?"</p>

<p>"But he's the hacker. And he's coming from our lab-wide
ethernet."</p>

<p>"Big deal. There's a dozen ways to get there." Wayne turned to
another terminal. "I'll just switch on my friendly ethernet analyzer,
and see who's doing what."</p>

<p>As Wayne typed in the parameters, I thought about the implications
of finding the hacker on our local network. Our ethernet was a party
line that snaked through every office. That he found a way into the
ether was bad news: it meant that the hacker could attack even
personal computers attached to the ethernet.</p>

<p>But maybe this would prove to be good news. Perhaps the hacker
lived here in Berkeley and worked at our laboratory. If so, we were
closing in on him quickly. Wayne would trace the ethernet to within a
few feet of the source.</p>

<p>"Here's your connection. He's coming from . . . from the computer
that controls the MFE net."</p>

<p>"You mean the hacker is entering our lab through the MFE
network?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. He's coming from Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. The Magnetic
Fusion Energy Network.</p>

<p>I called down the hallway, "Hey, Dave! Guess who's visiting
Livermore?"</p>

<p>Dave ambled over to Wayne's office. "How'd he get there? There's no
connection from there into our Unix system."</p>

<p>"I don't know how he got into Livermore, but he's in our ethernet,
coming from Livermore."</p>

<p>Dave raised his eyebrows. "I didn't know you could do that. Your
hacker found a path to the Unix system that I didn't know about."</p>

<p>Wayne launched into Dave with his usual tirade against Unix. I left
the two bosom enemies and called Livermore.<a id="p90"
name="p90"></a></p>

<p>It took three calls to find the system manager of the MFE
network. "Hi, you don't know me, but you've got a hacker in your
system."</p>

<p>A woman answered, "Huh? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I work at LBL. Someone's messing around in my computer and he's
coming in from the MFE network. It looks like he's logged in from
Livermore."</p>

<p>"Oh, hell. I'll scan our users. . . . There's only one job that's
connected from Livermore to Berkeley. Account 1674 ... it belongs to
someone named Cromwell."</p>

<p>"That's him," I said. "The hacker found the password a couple hours
ago. Got the password from a command file here in Berkeley."</p>

<p>"I'll kill that account. Cromwell can use our system, when he
learns to keep his passwords secret." She saw the problem as ignorant
users, not unfriendly systems that forced people to use bizarre
passwords like <em>agnitfom.</em></p>

<p>"Can you trace the connection?" I wanted Livermore to keep the
hacker on line, at least long enough to trace the line.</p>

<p>"No, we're not authorized to make any traces. You'll have to talk
to our management first."</p>

<p>"But by the time anyone decides, the hacker will be gone."</p>

<p>"We run a secure installation," she said. "If anyone finds out
there's a hacker at Livermore, heads will roll."</p>

<p>"Unless you trace where the hacker's coming from, you'll never know
if he's out of your system."</p>

<p>"My job is to run a computer. Not to catch criminals. Leave me out
of your wild-goose chase."</p>

<p>She decided to chop off all access and disable the stolen
account. The hacker disappeared from Livermore's computer, and from
ours.</p>

<p>Maybe it was just as well. Even if she had started a trace, I
couldn't monitor what the hacker was doing. I could detect that he was
in my computer, all right. But the MFE network connected directly into
my computer, without going through the switchyard. My printers
wouldn't capture what the hacker typed.</p>

<p>Depressed, I shuffled to lunch. At the LBL cafeteria, Luis Alvarez
sat down across from me. Inventor, physicist, and Nobel Laureate, Luie
was the twentieth-century<a id="p91" name="p91"></a> Renaissance
man. He didn't waste time on bureaucracy; he demanded results.</p>

<p>"How's astronomy?" Even from the stratosphere, Alvarez still found
time to talk to pipsqueaks like me. "Still building that
telescope?"</p>

<p>"Naw, I'm working at the computer center now. I ought to be writing
programs, but I've been spending all my time chasing a hacker."</p>

<p>"Any luck?"</p>

<p>"It's playing hide-and-seek over the wires. First I think he's
coming from Berkeley, then Oakland, then Alabama, then
Virginia. Lately I've traced him to Livermore."</p>

<p>"Called the FBI?"</p>

<p>"Six times. They've got better things to do. The frustrating part
is the complete lack of support." I told him about the morning's
activity at Livermore.</p>

<p>"Yes, they've got their jobs to worry about."</p>

<p>"But I'm trying to help them, damn it. They don't care that their
neighbor's being burglarized."</p>

<p>"Stop acting like a crusader, Cliff. Why don't you look at this as
research. Nobody else is interested&#8212;not Livermore, not the
FBI. Hell, in a week or two, probably not even our lab's
administration."</p>

<p>"They gave me three weeks. It's already up."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean. When you're doing real research, you never
know what it'll cost, how much time it'll take, or what you'll
find. You just know there's unexplored territory and a chance to
discover what's out there."</p>

<p>"That's easy for you to say. But I've got to keep three managers
off my back. There are programs to write and systems to manage."</p>

<p>"So what? You're following a fascinating scent. You're an
explorer. Think of who might be behind it. Some international spy,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"More likely some bored high school kid."</p>

<p>"Well then, forget who's causing the problems," Luie said. "Don't
try to be a cop, be a scientist. Research the connections, the
techniques, the holes. Apply physical principles. Find new methods to
solve problems. Compile statistics, publish your results, and only
trust what you can prove. But don't exclude improbable
solutions&#8212;keep your mind open."<a id="p92" name="p92"></a></p>

<p>"But what do I do when I hit a brick wall?"</p>

<p>"Like Livermore's system manager?" asked Luie.</p>

<p>"Or the telephone company withholding a phone trace. Or the FBI
refusing a court order. Or our laboratory shutting me down in a couple
days?"</p>

<p>"Dead ends are illusory. When did you ever let a 'Do Not Enter'
sign keep you away from anything? Go around the brick walls. When you
can't go around, climb over or dig under. Just don't give up."</p>

<p>"But who's going to pay my salary?"</p>

<p>"Permission, bah. Funding, forget it. Nobody will pay for research;
they're only interested in results," Luie said. "Sure, you could write
a detailed proposal to chase this hacker. In fifty pages, you'll
describe what you knew, what you expected, how much money it would
take. Include the names of three qualified referees, cost benefit
ratios, and what papers you've written before. Oh, and don't forget
the theoretical justification.</p>

<p>"Or you could just chase the bastard. Run faster than him. Faster
than the lab's management. Don't wait for someone else, do it
yourself. Keep your boss happy, but don't let him tie you down. Don't
give them a standing target."</p>

<p>That's why Luie won a Nobel Prize. It wasn't what he did, so much
as how he went about it. He was interested in everything. From a few
rocks slightly enriched in the element iridium, he'd inferred that
meteorites (a source of iridium) must have struck the earth some
sixty-five million years ago. Despite skepticism from paleontologists,
he recognized those meteors to be the death knell of the
dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Luis Alvarez never saw the subatomic fragments that won his Nobel
prize. Instead, he photographed their trails inside bubble
chambers. He analyzed those trails&#8212;from their length, he
calculated the particles' lifetimes; from their curvature, their
charge and mass.</p>

<p>My research was a far cry from his, but what have I got to lose?
Maybe his techniques would work for me. How do you scientifically
research a hacker?</p>

<p>At 6:19 that evening, the hacker returned. This time, he came
through Tymnet. I didn't bother tracing it&#8212;no use rousting
everyone from dinner when they wouldn't give me the phone
number.<a id="p93" name="p93"></a></p>

<p>Instead, I sat and watched the hacker deliberately connect to the
MX computer, a PDP-10 at the MIT artificial intelligence labs in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. He logged in as user Litwin, and spent
almost an hour learning how to operate that computer. He seemed quite
unaccustomed to the MIT system, and he'd frequently ask for the
automated help facility. In an hour, he'd learned little more than how
to list files.</p>

<p>Perhaps because artificial intelligence research is so arcane, he
didn't find much. Certainly, the antique operating system didn't
provide much protection&#8212;any user could read anyone else's
files. But the hacker didn't realize this. The sheer impossibility of
understanding this system protected their information.</p>

<p>I worried about how the hacker might abuse our network connections
over the weekend. Rather than camping out in the computer room, I
pulled the plugs to all the networks. To cover my tracks, I posted a
greeting for every user logging in: "Due to building construction, all
networks are down until Monday." It would surely isolate the hacker
from the Milnet. By counting complaints, I could take a census of how
many people relied on this network.</p>

<p>Quite a few, it turned out. Enough to get me in trouble.</p>

<p>Roy Kerth was first. "Cliff, we're taking a lot of heat for the
network being down. A couple dozen people are bitching that they
haven't received electronic mail. Can you look into it?"</p>

<p>He must have believed the greeting! "Uh, sure. I'll see if I can
get it working right away."</p>

<p>It took five minutes to patch the network through. The boss thought
I'd done magic. I kept my mouth shut.</p>

<p>But while the network was down, the hacker had appeared. My only
record was a printout from the monitor, but that was enough. He had
shown up at 5:15 a.m. and tried to connect into a Milnet site in
Omaha, Nebraska. Disappeared two minutes later. From the network
directory, I found he tried to get into a defense contractor there,
SRI Inc.</p>

<p>I called Ken Crepea of SRI, and he hadn't noticed anyone trying to
get in. "But I'll call you back if I see anything strange."</p>

<p>Ken called back two hours later. "Cliff, you won't<a id="p94"
name="p94"></a> believe this, but I checked our accounting logs, and
someone's broken into my computer."</p>

<p>I believed him. "How do you know?"</p>

<p>"There's weekend connections from several places, on accounts that
ought to be dead."</p>

<p>"From where?"</p>

<p>"From Anniston, Alabama, and from Livermore, California. Someone
used our old account, <em>SAC.</em> It used to be used for the
Strategic Air Command, here in Omaha."</p>

<p>"Any idea how it was invaded?"</p>

<p>"Well, it never had much password protection," Ken said. "The
password was SAC. Guess we screwed up, huh?"</p>

<p>"What was he up to?"</p>

<p>"My accounting records don't say what he did. I can only tell the
times he connected."</p>

<p>He told me the times, and I entered them into my logbook. To
protect his system, Ken would change all passwords to all accounts,
and make each person show up in person to get a new password.</p>

<p>The hacker was on the Milnet through at least two other computers,
Anniston and Livermore. And probably MIT.</p>

<p>MIT. I'd forgotten to warn them. I called Karen Sollins of their
computer department and told her about Friday night's
intrusion. "Don't worry," she said, "there's not much on that
computer, and we're throwing it away in a few weeks."</p>

<p>"That's good to know. Can you tell me who owned the Litwin
account?" I wanted to know where the hacker got Litwin's password.</p>

<p>"He's a plasma physicist from the University of Wisconsin," she
said. "He uses Livermore's big computers, and ships his results to our
system." Doubtless, he left his MIT passwords on the Livermore
computer.</p>

<p>This hacker silently followed scientists from one computer to
another, picking up the crumbs they left. What he didn't know was that
someone was also picking up the crumbs he was leaving.<a id="p95"
name="p95"></a></p>

<h3>17</h3>

<p class="first">The hacker knew his way around the Milnet. Now I
could see the futility of closing him out of our computers. He'd just
come in through some other door. Perhaps I could nail my own doors
shut, but he'd still climb into other systems.</p>

<p>Nobody detected him. Unmolested, he had sneaked into Livermore,
SRI, Anniston, and MIT.</p>

<p>Nobody chased him. The FBI certainly didn't. The CIA and the Air
Force Office of Special Investigations couldn't or wouldn't do
anything.</p>

<p>Well, almost nobody. I followed him, but I couldn't figure out a
way to catch him. The telephone traces wouldn't pan out. And since he
used several networks, how was I to know where he came from? Today, he
might enter through my lab and break into a computer in Massachusetts,
but tomorrow, he might just as well enter the nets in Peoria and break
into Podunk. I could monitor him only when he touched my system.</p>

<p>It was time to give up and go back to astronomy and programming, or
make my site so inviting that he preferred to use Berkeley as a
jumping-off place.</p>

<p>Giving up seemed best. My three weeks had expired, and I heard
grumblings about "Cliffs quest for the Holy Grail." So long as it
looked like my chase might bear fruit, the lab would tolerate me, but
I had to show progress. For the past week, only the hacker had made
progress.</p>

<p>"Do research," Luis Alvarez had said. Well, OK, I'd watch this guy
and call it science. See what I can learn about networks, computer
security, and maybe the hacker himself.</p>

<p>So I reopened our doors and sure enough, the hacker entered and
poked around the system. He found one interesting file, describing new
techniques to design integrated circuits. I watched as he fired up
Kermit, the universal file-transfer program, to ship our file back to
his computer.</p>

<p>The Kermit program doesn't just copy a file from one<a id="p96"
name="p96"></a> computer to another. It constantly checks to make sure
there haven't been any mistakes in transmission. So when the hacker
launched our Kermit program, I knew he was starting the same program
on his own computer. I didn't know where the hacker was, but he
certainly used a computer, not just a simple terminal. This, in turn,
meant that the hacker could save all his sessions on a printout or
floppy disk. He didn't have to keep notes in longhand.</p>

<p>Kermit copies files from one system to another. The two computers
must cooperate&#8212;one sends a file, and the other receives
it. Kermit runs on both computers: one Kermit does the talking, the
other Kermit listens.</p>

<p>To make sure it doesn't make mistakes, the sending Kermit pauses
after each line, giving the listener a chance to say, "I got that line
OK, go on to the next one." The sending Kermit waits for that OK, and
goes on to send the next line. If there's a problem, the sending
Kermit tries again, until it hears an OK. Much like a phone
conversation where one person says "Uh huh" every few phrases.</p>

<p>My monitoring post sat between my system's Kermit and the
hacker's. Well, not exactly in the middle. My printer recorded their
dialogue, but was perched at the Berkeley end of a long connection. I
watched the hacker's computer grab our data and respond with
acknowledgments.</p>

<p>Suddenly it hit me. It was like sitting next to someone shouting
messages across a canyon. The echoes tell you how far the sound
traveled. To find the distance to the canyon wall, just multiply the
echo delay by half the speed of sound. Simple physics.</p>

<p>Quickly, I called our electronic technicians. Right away, Lloyd
Bellknap knew the way to time the echoes. "You just need an
oscilloscope. And maybe a counter." In a minute, he scrounged up an
antique oscilloscope from the Middle Ages, built when vacuum tubes
were the rage.</p>

<p>But that's all we needed to see these pulses. Watching the trace,
we timed the echoes. Three seconds. Three and a half seconds. Three
and a quarter seconds.</p>

<p>Three seconds for a round trip? If the signals traveled at the
speed of light (not a bad assumption), this meant the hacker was
279,000 miles away.</p>

<p>With appropriate pomp, I announced to Lloyd, "From<a id="p97"
name="p97"></a> basic physics, I conclude that the hacker lives on the
moon."</p>

<p>Lloyd knew his communications. "I'll give you three reasons why
you're wrong."</p>

<p>"OK, I know one of them," I said. "The hacker's signals might be
traveling through a satellite link. It takes a quarter second for
microwaves to travel from earth to the satellite and back."
Communications satellites orbit twenty-three thousand miles over the
equator.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's one reason," Lloyd said. "But you'd need twelve
satellite hops to account for that three-second delay. What's the real
reason for the delay?"</p>

<p>"Maybe the hacker has a slow computer."</p>

<p>"Not that slow. Though maybe the hacker has programmed his Kermit
to respond slowly. That's reason two."</p>

<p>"Aah! I know the third delay. The hacker's using networks that move
his data inside of packets. His packets are constantly being rerouted,
assembled, and disassembled. Every time they pass through another
node, it slows him down."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Unless you can count the number of nodes, you can't tell
how far away he is. In other words, 'You lose.' " Lloyd yawned and
returned to repairing a terminal.</p>

<p>But there was still a way to find the hacker's distance. After the
hacker left, I called a friend in Los Angeles and told him to connect
to my computer through AT&amp;T and Tymnet. He started Kermit running,
and I timed his echoes. Real short, maybe a tenth of a second.</p>

<p>Another friend, this time in Houston, Texas. His echoes were around
0.15 seconds. Three other people from Baltimore, New York, and Chicago
each had echo delays of less than a second.</p>

<p>New York to Berkeley is about two thousand miles. It had a delay of
around a second. So a three-second delay means six thousand
miles. Give or take a few thousand miles.</p>

<p>Weird. The path to the hacker must be more convoluted than I
suspected.</p>

<p>I bounced this new evidence off Dave Cleveland. "Suppose the hacker
lives in California, calls the East Coast, then connects to
Berkeley. That could explain the long delays."</p>

<p>"The hacker's not from California," my guru replied. "I tell you,
he just doesn't know Berkeley Unix."<a id="p98" name="p98"></a></p>

<p>"Then he's using a very slow computer." "Not likely, since he's no
slouch at Unix." "He's purposely slowed down his Kermit parameters?"
"Nobody does that&#8212;it wastes their time when they transfer
files."</p>

<p>I thought about the meaning of this measurement. My friends'
samples told me how much delay Tymnet and AT&amp;T introduced. Less
than a second. Leaving two seconds of delay unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Maybe my method was wrong. Maybe the hacker used a slow
computer. Or maybe he was coming through another network beyond the
AT&amp;T phone lines. A network I didn't know about.</p>

<p>Every new piece of data pointed in a different direction. Tymnet
had said Oakland. The phone company had said Virginia. His echoes said
four thousand miles beyond Virginia.</p>

<h3>18</h3>

<p class="first">By the end of September, the hacker was appearing
every other day. Often, he'd pop up his periscope, look around, and
disappear in a few minutes. Not enough time to trace, and hardly worth
getting excited about.</p>

<p>I was tense and a little guilty. I often passed up dinner at home
to sneak in some extra hacker watching.</p>

<p>The only way I could keep following the hacker was by disguising my
efforts as real work. I'd muck around with computer graphics to
satisfy the astronomers and physicists, then fool with the network
connections to satisfy my own curiosity. Some of our network software
actually needed my attention, but usually I was just tinkering to
learn how it worked. I called other computer centers ostensibly to
clear up network problems. But when I'd talk to them, I'd cautiously
bring up the subject of hackers&#8212;who else had hacker
problems?</p>

<p>Dan Kolkowitz at Stanford University was quite aware of hackers in
his computer. He was an hour's drive away from<a id="p99"
name="p99"></a> Berkeley, but that was an all-day bicycle ride. So we
compared notes on the phone, and wondered if we were watching the same
rodent gnawing at our systems.</p>

<p>Since I'd started watching my monitors, I'd seen an occasional
interloper trying to get onto my computer. Every few days, someone
would dial into the system and try to log on as <em>system</em>
or <em>guest.</em> These inevitably failed, so I didn't bother
following them. Dan had it much worse.</p>

<p>"Seems like every kid in Silicon Valley tries to break into
Stanford," Dan moaned. "They find out passwords to legitimate student
accounts, then waste computing and connect time. An annoyance, but
something we'll have to tolerate so long as Stanford's going to run a
reasonably open system."</p>

<p>"Have you thought about clamping down?"</p>

<p>"To really tighten up security would make everyone unhappy," Dan
said. "People want to share information, so they make most of the
files readable to everyone on their computer. They complain if we
force them to change their passwords. Yet they demand that their data
be private."</p>

<p>People paid more attention to locking their cars than securing
their data.</p>

<p>One hacker in particular annoyed Dan. "Bad enough that he found a
hole in Stanford's Unix system. But he had the nerve to call me on the
phone. He talked for two hours, at the same time pawing through my
systems files."</p>

<p>"Did you trace him?"</p>

<p>"I tried. While he was talking on the phone, I called the Stanford
police and the phone company. He was on for two hours, and they
couldn't trace it."</p>

<p>I thought of Lee Cheng at Pacific Bell. He needed just ten minutes
to trace clear across the country. And Tymnet unwound their network in
less than a minute.</p>

<p>We compared the two hackers. "My guy's not wrecking anything," I
said. Just scanning files and using my network connections."</p>

<p>"Precisely what I see. I changed my operating system so that I can
watch what he's doing."</p>

<p>My monitors were IBM PC's, not modified software, but the principle
was the same. "Do you see him stealing password files and system
utilities?"<a id="p100" name="p100"></a></p>

<p>"Yes. He uses the pseudonym of 'Pfloyd' . . . I bet he's a Pink
Floyd fan. He's only active late at night."</p>

<p>This was a difference. I often watched my hacker at noon. As I
thought about it, Stanford was following different people. If
anything, the Berkeley hacker seemed to prefer the name, "Hunter,"
though I knew him by the several different account names he stole.</p>

<p>Three days later, the headlines of the October 3 <em>San Francisco
Examiner</em> blared, "Computer Sleuths Hunt A Brilliant Hacker."
Reporter John Markoff had sniffed out the Stanford story. On the side,
the newspaper mentioned that this hacker had also gotten into the LBL
computers. Could this be true?</p>

<p>The story described Dan's snares and his inability to catch
Stanford's Pfloyd hacker. But the reporter got the pseudonym
wrong&#8212;the newspaper reported "a crafty hacker using the name
'Pink Floyd.' "</p>

<p>Cursing whoever leaked the story, I prepared to close things
up. Bruce Bauer of our tab's police department called and asked if I'd
seen the day's paper.</p>

<p>"Yeah. What a disaster. The hacker won't show up again."</p>

<p>"Don't be so sure," Bruce said. "This may be just the break we're
looking for."</p>

<p>"But he'll never show up, now that he knows that we know there's a
hacker in our system."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But he'll want to see if you shut him out of the
computer. And he's probably confident that if he can outwit the
Stanford people, he can sneak past us as well."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we're nowhere near tracing him."</p>

<p>"That's actually what I called about. It'll be a couple weeks
before we get the search warrant, but I'd like you to stay open until
then."</p>

<p>After he hung up, I wondered about his sudden interest. Could it be
the newspaper story? Or had the FBI finally taken an interest?</p>

<p>The next day, doubtless thanks to Bruce Bauer, Roy Keith told me to
keep working on following the hacker, though he pointedly said that my
regular duties should take precedence.</p>

<p>That was my problem. Every time the hacker showed up, I'd spend an
hour figuring out what he did and how it<a id="p101" name="p101"></a>
related to his other sessions. Then a few more hours calling people,
spreading the bad news. Then I'd record what happened in my
logbook. By the time I'd finished, the day was pretty much
wasted. Following our visitor was turning into a full-time job.</p>

<p>In my case, Bruce Bauer's intuition was right. The hacker returned
a week after the article appeared. On Sunday, October 12, at 1:41, I
was beating my head against some astronomy problem&#8212;something
about orthogonal polynomials&#8212;when my hacker alarm went off.</p>

<p>I ran down the hallway and found him logged into Sventek's old
account. For twelve minutes, he used my computer to connect to the
Milnet. From there, he went to the Anniston Army base, where he had no
trouble logging in as Hunt. He just checked his files and then
disconnected.</p>

<p>On Monday, Chuck McNatt from Anniston called.</p>

<p>"I dumped this weekend's accounting logs and found the hacker
again."</p>

<p>"Yes, he was on your system for a few minutes. Just long enough to
see if anyone was watching." My printouts told the whole story.</p>

<p>"I think I'd better close my doors to him," Chuck said. "There's
too much at risk here, and we don't seem to be making headway in
tracking him."</p>

<p>"Can't you stay open a bit longer?"</p>

<p>"It's already been a month, and I'm afraid of him erasing my
files." Chuck knew the dangers.</p>

<p>"Well, OK. Just be sure that you really eliminate him."</p>

<p>"I know. I'll change all the passwords and check for any holes in
the operating system."</p>

<p>Oh well. Others didn't quite have the patience to remain open to
this hacker. Or was it foolishness?</p>

<p>Ten days later, the hacker reappeared. I got to the switchyard just
as he was trying Anniston.</p>

</pre>

<p>Chuck had disabled the Hunt account, but hadn't changed the
password on the system account, <em>Bin.</em></p>

<p>The greeting message warned the hacker that someone had noticed
him. He quickly checked his Gnu-Emacs files, and found they had been
erased. He looked around the Anniston system and found one file that
had been created July 3. A file that gave him super-user
privileges. It was hidden in the public directory /usr/lib. An area
that anyone could write into. He'd named the file, ".d". The same name
he used to hide his files on our LBL system.</p>

<p>But he didn't execute that program. Instead he logged off the
Anniston system and disconnected from LBL.</p>

<p>Chuck hadn't noticed this special file. On the phone, he said he'd
changed every user's password&#8212;all two hundred. But he hadn't
changed any of the system passwords like <em>Bin,</em> since he
assumed he was the only one who knew them. He'd thought that he'd
thoroughly eradicated any dangerous files, but he'd missed a few.</p>

<p>That <em>.d</em> file at Anniston was a useful benchmark. The
hacker had laid this egg on July 3, yet remembered exactly where he'd
hidden it three months later.</p>

<p>He didn't guess or hunt around for the <em>.d</em> file. No, he
went straight for it.</p>

<p>After three months, I can't remember where I stash a file. At least
not without a notebook.</p>

<p>This hacker must be keeping track of what he's done.</p>

<p>I glanced at my own logbook. Somewhere, someone was keeping a
mirror-image notebook.</p>

<p>A kid on a weekend lark doesn't keep detailed notes. A college
joker won't patiently wait three months before checking his prank. No,
we were watching a deliberate, methodical attack, from someone who
knew exactly what he was doing.<a id="p103" name="p103"></a></p>

<h3>19</h3>

<p class="first">Even though you have to coast slowly by the
guardhouse, you can reach thirty miles an hour by pedaling down the
LBL hill. Tuesday evening I was in no hurry, but pedaled anyway: it's
a kicker to feel the wind. A mile downhill, then a rendezvous at the
Berkeley Bowl.</p>

<p>The old bowling alley was now a huge fruit and vegetable market,
the cheapest place for kiwis and guavas. Year 'round, it smelled of
mangoes&#8212;even in the fish section. Next to a pyramid of
watermelons, I saw Martha knocking some pumpkins, hunting for the
filling to our Halloween pie.</p>

<p>"Vell, Boris, ze secret microfilm is hidden in ze pumpkin patch."
Ever since I met the CIA, I was a spy in Martha's eyes.</p>

<p>We decided on a dozen little pumpkins for a carving party, and one
fresh big one for the pie. After stuffing them in our backpacks, we
biked home.</p>

<p>Three blocks from the fruit market, at the corner of Fulton and
Ward, there's a four-way stop. With a can of spray paint, someone's
changed one stop sign to read, "Stop the CIA." Another, "Stop the
NSA."</p>

<p>Martha grinned. I felt uneasy, and pretended to adjust my
backpack. I didn't need another reminder of Berkeley politics.</p>

<p>At home, she tossed pumpkins to me, and I stashed them in a
box. "What you're missing is a flag," she said, throwing the last one
low and inside, "some sort of pennant for chasing hackers."</p>

<p>She ducked into a closet. "I had a bit left over from my costume,
so I stitched this together." She unrolled a shirt-sized banner, with
a snake coiled around a computer. Underneath, it said, "Don't Tread on
Me."</p>

<p>In the weeks before Halloween, both of us sewed furiously to make
costumes. I'd made a pope's outfit, complete with miter, scepter and
chalice. Martha, of course, kept her<a id="p104" name="p104"></a>
costume hidden&#8212;you can't be too careful when your roommate uses
the same sewing machine.</p>

<p>Next day, I hoisted my hacker-hunter flag just above the four
monitors that watched the incoming Tymnet lines. I'd bought a cheap
Radio Shack telephone dialer, and connected it to an expensive but
obsolete logic analyzer. Together, these waited patiently for the
hacker to type in his password, and then silently called my
telephone.</p>

<p>Naturally, the flag fell down and got caught in the printer, just
as the hacker showed up. I quickly unsnarled the shreds of paper and
cloth, just in time to see the hacker change his passwords.</p>

<p>The hacker apparently didn't like his old
passwords&#8212; <em>hedges, jaeger, hunter and benson.</em> He
replaced them, one by one, with a single new
password, <em>lblhack.</em></p>

<p>Well, at least he and I agreed on what he was doing.</p>

<p>He picked the same password for four different accounts. If there
were four different people involved, they'd each have a separate
account and password. But here in one session, all four accounts were
changed.</p>

<p>I had to be following a single person. Someone persistent enough to
return over and over to my computer. Patient enough to hide a
poisonous file in the Anniston Army base and return to it three months
later. And peculiar in aiming at military targets.</p>

<p>He chose his own passwords. "Lblhack" was obvious. I'd searched the
Berkeley phone book for Jaegers and Ben-sons; maybe I ought to try
Stanford. I stopped by the library. Maggie Morley, our
forty-five-year-old document-meister, plays rough and tumble
Scrabble. Posted on her door is a list of all legal three-letter
Scrabble words. To get in, you have to ask her one. "Keeps 'em fresh
in my mind," she says.</p>

<p>"Bog," I said.</p>

<p>"You may enter."</p>

<p>"I need a Stanford telephone book," I said. "I'm looking for
everyone in Silicon Valley named Jaeger or Benson."</p>

<p>Maggie didn't have to search the card catalog. "You need
directories for Palo Alto and San Jose. Sorry, but we don't have
either. It'll take a week or so to order 'em."</p>

<p>A week wouldn't slow things down, at the rate I was
going.<a id="p105" name="p105"></a></p>

<p>"Jaeger. A word that's been kind to me," Maggie smiled. "Worth
sixteen points, but I once won a game with it, when the T landed on a
triple-letter score. Turned into seventy-five points."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I need it because it's the hacker's password. Hey, I
didn't know names were legal in Scrabble."</p>

<p>"Jaeger's not a name. Well, maybe it's a name&#8212;Ellsworth
Jaeger, the famous ornithologist, for instance&#8212;but it's a type
of bird. Gets its name from the German word meaning hunter."</p>

<p>"Huh? Did you say, 'Hunter'?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Jaegers are hunting birds that badger other birds with full
beaks. They harass weaker birds until they drop their prey."</p>

<p>"Hot ziggity! You answered my question. I don't need the phone
book."</p>

<p>"Well, what else can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"How about explaining the relationship between the
words <em>hedges, jaeger, hunter and benson?"</em></p>

<p>"Well, Jaeger and Hunter is obvious to anyone who knows German. And
smokers know Benson and Hedges."</p>

<p>Omigod&#8212;my hacker smokes Benson and Hedges. Maggie had won on
a triple-word score.</p>

<h3>20</h3>

<p class="first">I was all set on Halloween morning. I'd finished my
pope's costume, even the miter. Tonight's party would be a gas: pasta
with a dozen lunatics, followed by Martha's fantastic pumpkin pie, and
an excursion into San Francisco's Castro district.</p>

<p>But first I had to dodge my bosses at the lab. The physicists were
ganging up on the computer center, refusing to pay our
salaries. Supporting central computing was expensive. The scientists
figured that they could buy their own small machines, and avoid the
overhead of paying our programming staff.</p>

<p>Sandy Merola tried to convince them otherwise. "You<a id="p106"
name="p106"></a> can hitch a thousand chickens to your plow or one
horse. Central computing is expensive because we deliver results, not
hardware."</p>

<p>To placate them, Sandy sent me to write a few graphics
programs. "You're a scientist. If you can't make 'em happy, at least
listen to their problems."</p>

<p>So I spent the morning sitting in the back row of a physics
seminar. A professor droned on about the quark function of the
proton&#8212;something about how each proton has three quarks. I
wasn't tired enough to sleep, so I pretended to take notes while
thinking about the hacker.</p>

<p>Returning from the seminar, Sandy asked if I'd learned
anything.</p>

<p>"Sure." I glanced at my notes. "The distribution function of quarks
isn't quantized over the proton. Happy?"</p>

<p>"Be serious, Cliff. What did the physicists say about
computing?"</p>

<p>"Not much. They know they need us, but don't want to pay."</p>

<p>"Same as the Air Force," Sandy smiled. "I just got off the phone
with one Jim Christy of their Office of Special Investigations."</p>

<p>"Hey, isn't he the narc with the military spooks?"</p>

<p>"Be serious. He's a detective working for the Air Force,
please."</p>

<p>"OK, he's an all-American good guy. So what did he say?"</p>

<p>"He says the same thing as our physicists. They can't support us,
but they don't want us to go away."</p>

<p>"Did he make any progress with the Virginia phone company?"</p>

<p>"Naw. He called around, and they won't budge without a Virginia
search warrant. He checked out the Virginia state law, and the
hacker's committing no crime there."</p>

<p>"Breaking into our computer isn't a crime?" I couldn't believe
it.</p>

<p>"Breaking into a California computer isn't a crime in
Virginia."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose the Air Force can lean on the FBI to get a
warrant?"</p>

<p>"Nope. But they want us to keep monitoring, at least until the Air
Force decides it's a dead end."<a id="p107" name="p107"></a></p>

<p>"Did they cough up any dimes?" My time was funded through the
grants of astronomers and physicists. They weren't pleased to watch me
spend their money chasing some ghost.</p>

<p>"No bucks, nothing but an unofficial request. When I asked for
support, Jim gave me the bailiwick story."</p>

<p>Sandy wasn't going to give in. "It's been two months since we
started, and nobody's listened to us. Let's stay open for another
week, then call it quits."</p>

<p>By five o'clock, I was ready for the Halloween party. On my way
out, I checked the floppy disks on the monitors. The printer suddenly
started up. There was the hacker. I glanced at the time&#8212;17:43:11
PST.</p>

<p>No. Not now. I've got a party to go to. A costume party no
less. Can't he choose any other time?</p>

<p>The hacker logged into the old Sventek account, and checked who was
on our system. Dave Cleveland was there, running under the alias of
Sam Rubarb, but the hacker couldn't know.</p>

<p>He moved over to our accounting files, and collected the past
month's files in one place. He scanned that long file, searching for
the word "Pink Floyd."</p>

<p>Hmmmm. Interesting. He didn't search for the word "Pfloyd," which
was the Stanford hacker's pseudonym. Rather, he searched for the
pseudonym that was reported in the newspaper.</p>

<p>My hacker wasn't the same guy as Stanford's. If he were, he
wouldn't have to search for "Pink Floyd"&#8212;he'd know when he had
been active.</p>

<p>In fact, my hacker wasn't even in contact with Stanford's. If the
two had met, or even written to each other, my hacker would know to
search for "Pfloyd," not "Pink Floyd."</p>

<p>The hacker must have read the news. But it had been almost a month
since the article was published. Dave Cleveland must be right: the
hacker wasn't from the West Coast.</p>

<p>At 6 P.M., the hacker gave up searching our accounting
logs. Instead, he went through our computer onto the Milnet. From
there, he went straight for the Anniston army base in Alabama. "Which
hole will he sneak into this time?" I wondered.<a id="p108"

<p>Chuck McNatt had finally locked him out. By changing all his
passwords, Chuck had nailed his door shut. He still might have holes
in his system, but this hacker couldn't exploit them.</p>

<p>The hacker didn't give up. He reached over into the building design
group.</p>

<p>Some scientists at Lawrence Berkeley Lab worry about how to design
energy efficient homes. Most other physicists look down on
them&#8212;"Yech, applied physics." Protons and quarks are
sexy. Saving ten dollars on your monthly heating bill isn't.</p>

<p>The building design group searches for new glasses that let light
in, but block the infra-red. They build new insulators to prevent heat
leaks through walls. They'd just started analyzing basements and
chimneys for thermal efficiency.</p>

<p>The hacker learned this because he dumped all their files. Page
after page of thermal emissivity data. Memos about paint absorption in
the ultraviolet. And a note saying, "You can move to the Elxsi
computer next week."</p>

<p>He didn't need to see that note twice. He interrupted his listing,
and commanded my Unix computer to connect him to the Elxsi system.</p>

<p>I'd never heard of this computer. But my computer had. Within ten
seconds, he'd made the connection and the Elxsi prompted him for an
account name and password. I watched him try to get in:</p>

<pre>
LBL&gt; Telnet Elxsi Elxsi at LBL<a id="p109" name="p109"></a>
login: <u>root</u> password: <u>root</u> Incorrect password, try
again.  login: <u>guest</u> password: <u>guest</u> incorrect password,
try again.  login: <u>uucp</u> password: <u>uucp</u> WELCOME TO THE
ELXSI COMPUTER AT LBL
</pre>

<p>He got into the UUCP account. No password protection. Wide
open.</p>

<p>UUCP is the account for Unix to Unix copying. When one Unix
computer wants to copy a file from another, it logs into the UUCP
account and gets the file. People should never be able to connect to
this special account. The system manager should disable it from human
log-ins.</p>

<p>Worse, this Elxsi had its UUCP account set up with system
privileges. It took the hacker only a minute to realize that he'd
stumbled into a privileged account.</p>

<p>He didn't lose any time. He edited the password file, and added a
new account, one with system manager privileges. Named
it <em>Mark.</em> "Keep it bland," I thought.</p>

<p>But he didn't know much about this computer. He spent an hour
dumping its files, and learned about designing energy efficient
buildings. Nothing about the computer itself.</p>

<p>So he wrote a program to time the Elxsi computer. A short C program
that measured its speed and reported its word length.</p>

<p>He needed three tries to get his program to work, but finally it
flew. He found the Elxsi to have thirty-two bit words, and he measured
it at about ten million instructions per second.</p>

<p>Eight-bit and sixteen-bit computers are diddlysquat machines; the
thirty-two-bit systems are the biggies. Thirty-two bits meant a big
machine, ten MIPS meant fast. He'd entered a super-minicomputer. One
of the fastest in Berkeley. One of the most mismanaged.</p>

<p>As I watched him walk through the Elxsi, I talked to Tymnet. While
the hacker tried to understand the new<a id="p110" name="p110"></a>
computer, Ron Vivier searched out the needle that pointed where the
hacker came from.</p>

<p>"No news. He's coming in from Oakland again." Ron knew that meant a
phone trace.</p>

<p>"No use calling the phone company. They'll just tell me to get a
Virginia search warrant."</p>

<p>I hung up, disappointed. A long connection like this was perfect
for tracing him. I couldn't shut him out of our system when he was
into computers I'd never even heard of. When he finally signed off at
7:30, he'd pretty much mapped out our lab's major computers. He might
not be able to get into each of them, but he knew where they were.</p>

<p>7:30. Damn, I'd forgotten the party. I ran down to my bike and
pedaled home. This hacker wasn't wrecking my computer, he was
destroying my life. Being late for a Halloween party&#8212;that's a
capital crime in Martha's book.</p>

<p>Not only was I late, but I'd shown up without a costume. I slinked
guiltily through the kitchen door. What a scene! Princess Diana,
tastefully attired in a tailored dress, pillbox hat and white gloves,
shuddered as she removed a dripping handful of seeds from a
pumpkin. Alice and the Mad Hatter were serving the last of the
lasagna. Charlie Chaplin was dipping apples in caramel. In the midst
of this swirl of activity stood a small but fierce samurai warrior in
full battle gear, shouting orders. "You're late," the samurai
scowled. "Where's your costume?"</p>

<p>Buried in the back of the closet, I found my white velvet
robe. Worn over Martha's nightgown, with a sheet pinned around my
shoulders and a tall, jeweled miter of construction paper and sequins,
I suddenly became . . . Pope Cliff the First. I went around blessing
the guests. Martha's friend Laurie, who usually wore a crew cut,
jeans, and hiking boots, sidled up in a short black cocktail dress and
long pearl necklace. "Come on, your holiness, let's go forth and bless
the Castro."</p>

<p>We piled into the Mad Hatter's car (Laurie rode her motorcycle) and
crossed the bridge to Babylon. Halloween is San Francisco's favorite
holiday. Five blocks along Castro Street are cordoned off, and
thousands of elaborately costumed revelers jostle up and down, looking
at one another and at the drag queens in sequined gowns
who<a id="p111" name="p111"></a> lipsync to Ethel Merman on the fire
escapes overlooking the street.</p>

<p>This year's costumes were incredible: a person dressed as a giant
bag of groceries, complete with giant paper replicas of vegetables and
cans; various creatures from outer space; and several rival samurai,
whom Martha fought off with her plastic sword. White-faced draculas
mingled with witches, kangaroos, and butterflies. Over near the
trolley stop, an assortment of ghouls harmonized with a three-legged
pickle.</p>

<p>I offered benedictions left and right&#8212;to demons and angels,
gorillas and leopards. Medieval knights knelt to me, and nuns (some
with mustaches) rushed up to greet me. A trio of sturdy, cheerful
fellows in pink tutus and size-thirteen ballet shoes bowed gracefully
to receive my blessings.</p>

<p>Despite layoffs at the factories, rent payments due, drugs, and
AIDS, somehow San Francisco celebrated life.</p>

<p>Next Monday I showed up late, expecting to find a message from the
manager of the Elxsi computer. No such luck. I called around the
building design group, and talked with the physicist in charge of the
Elxsi computer.</p>

<p>"Noticed anything strange on your Elxsi?"</p>

<p>"No, we've only had it a month. Anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"Who set up your accounts?"</p>

<p>"I did. I just signed on as system manager, then added users."</p>

<p>"Do you run accounting?"</p>

<p>"No. I didn't know you could."</p>

<p>"Someone broke into your computer through the UUCP account. He
became system manager and added a new account."</p>

<p>"I'll be damned. What's the UUCP account?"</p>

<p>Here's the problem. This guy's a physicist, bored by computers. He
didn't know about managing his machine. Probably didn't care.</p>

<p>This guy wasn't the problem. Elxsi was. They sold their computers
with the security features disabled. After you buy their machine, it's
up to you to secure it. Just plow through a dozen manuals to find a
paragraph saying how to modify the permissions granted to the UUCP
account. If you know that account exists.<a id="p112"
name="p112"></a></p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>The same thing must be happening all over. The hacker didn't
succeed through sophistication. Rather he poked at obvious places,
trying to enter through unlocked doors. Persistence, not wizardry, let
him through.</p>

<p>Well, he wasn't going to get into our Elxsi anymore. Knowing my
adversary, I could easily lock him out in a way that would mystify
him. I built a trap door into our Elxsi: whenever the hacker touched
the purloined accounts on that machine, it notified me and pretended
to be too busy to accept another user. The Elxsi didn't say, "Go
away"; rather, it slowed down to a crawl whenever the hacker showed
up. The hacker wouldn't realize that we were on to him, yet the Elxsi
was protected against him.</p>

<p>Still, we were treading water. Without search warrants, our phone
traces went nowhere. Sure, we read every word he typed into our
computer, but how much did we miss? He might be using a dozen other
computers to get onto the Milnet.</p>

<p>This much is for sure: I was now dedicated to catching this
hacker. The only way to snag this guy was to watch every minute of the
day. I had to be ready all the time&#8212; noon or midnight.</p>

<p>That was the problem. Sure, I could sleep under my desk and rely on
my terminal to wake me up. But at the cost of the domestic
tranquility: Martha wasn't pleased at my office campouts.</p>

<p>If only my computer would call me whenever the hacker appeared,
then the rest of the time would be my own. Like a doctor on call.</p>

<p>Of course. A pocket pager. I had a bank of personal computers
watching for the hacker to appear. I'd just program them to dial my
pocket pager. I'd have to rent a pager, but it'd be worth the $20 a
month.</p>

<p>It took an evening to write the programs&#8212;no big deal. From
now on, wherever I went, I'd know within seconds of the hacker's
arrival. I'd become an extension of my computer.</p>

<p>It was him against me now. For real.<a id="p113"

<p class="first">Lawrence Berkeley Labs is funded by the Department of
Energy, the successor to the Atomic Energy Commission. Perhaps nuclear
bombs and atomic power plants are fading into the mists of history, or
maybe splitting atoms isn't as sexy as it used to be. For whatever
reason, the DOE isn't the same animated team that started atomic
energy plants two decades ago. I'd heard rumors that over the years,
the organization had silted up like the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The DOE may not be the most nimble of our many Governmental
agencies, but they did pay our bills. For over a month, we'd kept
silent about our problem, worrying that the hacker might find out we
were tracking him. Now that our trace led far from Berkeley, it seemed
safe to tell our funding agency about the hacker.</p>

<p>On November 12, I called around the DOE, trying to find out who I
should talk to about a computer break-in. It took a half dozen calls
to find out that nobody really wanted to listen. Eventually I reached
the DOE manager of computer security for unclassified computers.</p>

<p>Rick Carr listened patiently as I told him about the hacker,
occasionally interrupting with questions. "Is he still active in your
computer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and we're homing in on him every time he shows up."</p>

<p>He didn't seem especially excited. "Well when you catch him, let us
know."</p>

<p>"Want a copy of my logbook?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No. Keep it quiet until you're through."</p>

<p>I explained our need for search warrants and the FBI's lack of
interest. "Any chance you might be able to get the FBI to open a
case?"</p>

<p>"No, I wish they did, but the FBI doesn't listen to us," Rick
said. "I'd like to help, but it's just not my bailiwick."</p>

<p>Bailiwicks again. I mumbled my thanks, and was about to hang up
when Rick said, "You might want to call the National Computer Security
Center, though."<a id="p114" name="p114"></a></p>

<p>"Who are they?" Seemed like a group that I should have heard
of.</p>

<p>Rick explained, "The NCSC is a sidekick of the National Security
Agency. They're supposed to make standards for securing computers."
From his emphasis on the word "supposed," it sounded like they
weren't.</p>

<p>"Since when does the NSA talk to the public?" I'd always thought
that the NSA was the most secret of all government agencies.</p>

<p>"The computer security section of NSA is the only part of NSA
that's unclassified," Rick said. "Because of this, they're treated as
ugly ducklings within NSA. Nobody from the secret side of the house
will talk to them."</p>

<p>"And since they're a part of the NSA, nobody from the public trusts
them either." I realized where he was leading.</p>

<p>"Right. They take flack from both sides. But you ought to tell them
about your hacker. They're certain to be interested, and they might
just rattle the right cages in the bureaucracy."</p>

<p>Next call: the National Computer Security Center. Zeke Hanson was
their desk officer. His voice was cheerful and he seemed fascinated by
the idea of silently watching a hacker. He wanted all the technical
details of our monitors and alarms.</p>

<p>"You're an intercept operator," Zeke informed me.</p>

<p>"What's that?" I'd never heard of it.</p>

<p>He stammered a bit, as if he wanted to unsay his last sentence. I
figured out what he meant on my own. NSA must have thousands of people
watching teletypes around the world. Intercept operators, huh?</p>

<p>Zeke asked about my computer. I explained, "A couple of Vaxes
running Unix. Lots of networks." For the next twenty minutes, I told
him about the holes that the hacker exploited&#8212;Gnu-Emacs,
passwords, Trojan horses. It hit him where he lived.</p>

<p>But when I asked if there was any way that he could finagle a
search warrant, he clammed up tight.</p>

<p>"I'll have to talk to my colleagues about this."</p>

<p>Well, what did I expect? Ideally, I'd call an electronic spy on the
phone, explain my need for a search warrant, and he'd kick the FBI
into acting. Right. How would I react<a id="p115" name="p115"></a> to
someone calling my observatory, reporting an invader from some unknown
planet?</p>

<p>Still, I might as well explain our problem. "Look, we're about to
call it quits. If someone doesn't help out, we're giving up on this
monitoring. I've had it with being a volunteer intercept
operator."</p>

<p>Not a dent. "Cliff, I'd like to take over, but our charter prevents
it. NSA can't engage in domestic monitoring, even if we're
asked. That's prison term stuff."</p>

<p>He took this seriously. NCSC or NSA, whichever he worked for,
wouldn't monitor my hacker. They'd advise me on how to protect my
computers and serve as a liaison to the FBI, but they wouldn't take
over my monitoring.</p>

<p>Getting a search warrant? Zeke would look into it, but didn't offer
much help. "If you can't interest the FBI, I doubt that they'll listen
to us. We're here to make computers more secure, not to catch
criminals."</p>

<p>Another bailiwick problem.</p>

<p>I hung up, discouraged. Five minutes later, I walked down the
hallway and asked myself what I was doing talking to the NSA.</p>

<p>Maybe Martha was right. She'd said I was on a slippery slope that
led into deep water. First you call the FBI, then the CIA, now the
NSA.</p>

<p>But it wasn't the spooks that bothered me. It was their
inaction. Sure, they all listened to my troubles, but not one would
lift a finger.</p>

<p>Frustrating. Every agency seemed to have a good reason to do
nothing. Disgusted, I paced the halls.</p>

<p>The hallways at Lawrence Berkeley Labs look like a plumber's
nightmare. There's no suspended ceiling tiles to hide the pipes,
cables, and ducts. Looking up, I recognized the steam pipes, and the
orange ethernet cables. The steam runs at about one hundred pounds per
square inch, the ethernet at around ten million bits per second.</p>

<p>My networks were as essential to the lab as steam, water, or
electricity.</p>

<p>Did I say, "my networks?" The networks were no more mine than the
steam pipes belonged to the plumbers. But someone had to treat them as
his own, and fix the leaks.<a id="p116" name="p116"></a></p>

<p>Something strange was happening to me. In a daze, I sat down on the
hallway floor, still staring up at the pipes. For the first time in my
life, something important was entirely up to me. My attitude at work
had always been like my days as an astronomer&#8212;I'd write
proposals, observe at the telescope, publish papers, and stand
cynically apart from the struggles and triumphs of the world around
me. I didn't care if my research led anywhere.</p>

<p>Now, nobody was telling me what to do, yet I had a choice: should I
quietly let things drop? Or do I take arms against this sea of
troubles?</p>

<p>Staring at the pipes and cables, I realized that I could no longer
fool around behind the scenes, an irreverent, zany kid. I was
serious. I cared. The network community depended on me, without even
knowing it. Was I becoming (oh, no!) responsible?</p>

<h3>22</h3>

<p class="first">That evening, Martha studied criminal procedure at
Boalt Hall Law Library. I stopped by to deliver some bagels and cream
cheese, the high-octane fuel of law students. We necked and pecked
among the books, occasionally dodging a zombie cramming for the bar
exam. Aah, Boalt library, where the law never sleeps.</p>

<p>In a back room, she showed me the law school's Lexis
computer. "Hey, want to play with a fun toy while I study?" she
asked.</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, she switched on the Lexis
terminal. She pointed to the sign giving instructions on how to log
into the document search system. She dived back into her books,
leaving me with some unknown computer.</p>

<p>The instructions couldn't be plainer. Just press a couple buttons,
type the account name, a password, and begin searching judicial
records for whatever seems interesting. Next to the instructions were
scribbled five account names and passwords, so I picked a pair and
logged in. Nobody had thought to protect its passwords. I wondered how
many<a id="p117" name="p117"></a> former law students were still
freeloading from the library.</p>

<p>So I logged into the law computer and searched on the
keywords <em>telephone trace.</em> It took a while to understand the
legal jargon, but eventually I stumbled on the law regulating
telephone traces. It turned out that a search warrant wasn't necessary
to trace a phone call made to your own telephone, so long as you
wanted the trace made.</p>

<p>This made sense. You shouldn't need a court order to find out who
was calling you. Indeed, some telephone companies now sell phones that
display the digits of the calling telephone as your phone is
ringing.</p>

<p>But if we didn't legally need a search warrant, why were the phone
companies so insistent? Monday morning, clutching a xerox of 18 USCA
&#167;3121, I called Lee Cheng at the phone company. "Why do you make
us get search warrants, when the law doesn't require it?"</p>

<p>"It's partly to protect ourselves from lawsuits and partly to
filter out worthless traces," Lee said.</p>

<p>"Well, if the warrant isn't required, why won't the Virginia phone
company release the information?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. But they won't. I've spent half an hour talking to them,
and they won't budge." If they wouldn't release the number to another
phone company, there wasn't much chance they'd tell my lab. Looked
like the phone trace was a dead end after all.</p>

<p>Aletha Owens, our lawyer, called. "The FBI won't give us the time
of day, let alone a search warrant."</p>

<p>Same story with our lab police. They'd called around and got
nowhere. Dead end.</p>

<p>Over lunch at the lab cafeteria, I described the past week's
adventures to two astronomer pals, Jerry Nelson and Terry Mast.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that they traced the call and won't tell you the
number?" Jerry asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"That's about the size of it. No tickee, no laundry."</p>

<p>Between sandwiches, I showed them my logbook. A couple weeks ago,
while the phone technician was tracing the line, I'd copied all her
jargon into my logbook. Now, Jerry started interpreting like a palm
reader.</p>

<p>"Hey, look, Cliff&#8212;the phone technician said 703," Jerry
said. "Area code 703 is in Virginia. And C and P ... I bet<a id="p118"
name="p118"></a> that's Chesapeake and Potomac. Yeah. They're the
phone company for northern and western Virginia."</p>

<p>Terry Mast is an experimentalist. "You copied those numbers that
the phone technician said. Why not call every permutation of those
numbers in area code 703, and find out if there's a computer
there?"</p>

<p>Jerry Nelson looked at my notes. "Yeah, that oughta work. The
technician said 1060 and 427 and 448. Try calling 703/427-1060. Or
maybe 448-1060. There's only a few combinations."</p>

<p>It was worth a try. But I'd be slightly more devious.</p>

<p>I called my local telephone business office and said, "I have a
couple calls on my bill that I don't remember making. Could you tell
me who I dialed?"</p>

<p>The operator was completely cooperative. "Just read me the numbers
and I'll check them for you."</p>

<p>I told her six possible numbers, all in area code 703. Ten minutes
later, she called back. "I'm very sorry, but five of those numbers are
nonexistent or out of service. I don't know how you got billed for
them."</p>

<p>Five of the six were bad numbers! One might just do it. I said, "Oh
yes, that's all right. Who is the owner of the sixth number?"</p>

<p>"That's Mitre Incorporated, spelled M-I-T-R-E, at
703/448-1060. Would you like me to start a refund for those five other
calls?"</p>

<p>"I'm in a hurry right now. I'll take care of it later."</p>

<p>Nervously, I dialed the phone number, ready to hang up when I heard
a voice. A computer's modem answered with a high-pitched whistle. Far
out!</p>

<p>Mitre. I knew of a defense contractor, Mitre, in Massachusetts. But
not in Virginia. I'd seen their ads in electronics
magazines&#8212;they were always looking for programmers who were
U.S. citizens. Digging through the library, I found that, yes, Mitre
did have a branch in Virginia. McLean, Virginia.</p>

<p>Strange. Where had I heard of that city? The library's atlas told
me.</p>

<p>The CIA's headquarters are in McLean.<a id="p119"
name="p119"></a></p>

<h3>23</h3>

<p class="first">I couldn't believe it. The hacking seemed to be
coming from Mitre in McLean, Virginia&#8212;a couple of miles from CIA
headquarters. Time to call the boss.</p>

<p>"Hey, Dennis, the calls are coming from Mitre. It's a defense
contractor just down the road from CIA headquarters. What do you think
Teejay will say to that?"</p>

<p>"How do you know it's Mitre?"</p>

<p>"Well, during the phone trace, I copied down all the numbers and
digits that I heard from the technician. I called all combinations of
them, and ended up at a computer modem at Mitre."</p>

<p>"So you're not certain." Dennis saw the hole in my argument. "If we
spread this around and we're wrong, we'll be in hot water."</p>

<p>"But what are the chances of randomly dialing a telephone and
getting a computer to answer?"</p>

<p>"I don't care. Until you find some proof, don't act on it. Don't
call Mitre. And don't tell our spooky friends."</p>

<p>Back to square one. I think I know the phone number of the hacker
but how to prove it?</p>

<p>Aah! Just wait until the hacker calls back again. Then see if the
phone is busy. If it's busy, then likely I've got the right
number.</p>

<p>There was another way to get the phone number. Less sophisticated,
but more reliable.</p>

<p>Back in graduate school, I'd learned how to survive without
funding, power, or even office space. Grad students are lowest in the
academic hierarchy, and so they have to squeeze resources from between
the cracks. When you're last on the list for telescope time, you make
your observations by hanging around the mountaintop, waiting for a
slice of time between other observers. When you need an electronic
gizmo in the lab, you borrow it in the evening, use it all night, and
return it before anyone notices. I didn't learn much about planetary
physics, but weaseling came naturally.<a id="p120"
name="p120"></a></p>

<p>Still, I couldn't finagle a federal search warrant. All I had were
the standard tools of astronomers. Exactly enough to get the
information I needed.</p>

<p>I dialed Chesapeake and Potomac's business office and asked for the
security office. After a few transfers, I recognized the voice of the
technician that had traced last week's call.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of casual chat, she mentioned that her
eleven-year-old kid was fascinated by astronomy. I saw my
opening. "Think he'd like some star charts and posters of the
planets?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Especially that ringed thing, you know, Saturn."</p>

<p>One of the few resources that I've plenty of: pictures of planets
and galaxies. We talked a bit about her kid, and I returned to the
matter on my mind.</p>

<p>"By the way, I think the hacker is coming from Mitre, over in
McLean. 448-1060. Does this agree with your trace?"</p>

<p>"I'm not supposed to release this information, but since you
already know the number. . . ."</p>

<p>Aah! Grad school comes through.</p>

<p>I rolled a dozen posters into a mailing tube. Today, somewhere in
Virginia, a kid's wall sports a collection of planetary and galactic
photos.</p>

<p>McLean, Virginia ... I knew more about Mars than McLean. I called
my sister, Jeannie, who lived somewhere near there. At least she had
the same area code.</p>

<p>Jeannie had, indeed, heard of Mitre. They weren't just a defense
contractor grabbing secret Pentagon contracts. They also had ties to
the CIA and the NSA. Among thousands of other projects, Mitre tested
computers for security. When someone needed a secure computer, Mitre
certified it.</p>

<p>Odd. The hacker came from a company that certifies secure
computers. Maybe one of their testers was fooling around on the side?
Or did Mitre have some secret contract to explore security on the
military networks?</p>

<p>Time to call Mitre. It took five phone calls to pierce their veil
of secretaries, but eventually I reached a man named Bill
Chandler.</p>

<p>It took fifteen minutes to convince him that there really was a
problem. "Simply impossible. We're running a<a id="p121"
name="p121"></a> secure shop, and nobody can break in." I described my
traces, leaving out the missing search warrants.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know if someone's hacking from our computers, but if
they are, they're sure not coming from the outside."</p>

<p>It took another ten minutes before he'd accept that it
was <em>his</em> problem. Five more to decide what to do.</p>

<p>I proposed a simple solution. Simple for me, at least. "The next
time the hacker's connected to Berkeley, just examine Mitre's
telephone line. Find out who's connected to it."</p>

<p>Bill Chandler agreed. He'd round up some technicians and quietly
watch Mitre's telephone line, 448-1060. As soon as I'd call him, he'd
trace his internal network and find the culprit.</p>

<p>"I doubt we'll find much," he said. "It's impossible to break into
our secure site, and all our employees have clearances."</p>

<p>Right. If he wanted to keep his head in the sand, it was all right
with me. Maybe one of Mitre's employees was screwing around the
military networks, just for kicks. But what if this was an organized
effort?</p>

<p>If so, who was behind it? Could some secret agency have hired
Mitre? If so, it had to be someone right around the corner. Someone
just a couple miles away. Time to call the CIA.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, I'm on the phone with Teejay. "Uh, I don't know
how to ask this, and you probably can't tell me anyway, but what are
the chances that our hacker is someone from the CIA?"</p>

<p>Teejay wouldn't consider it. "Absolutely zero. We don't pry into
domestic affairs. Period."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say for certain, but it looks like our phone traces
lead to Virginia, and I was just wondering if . . ."I let my voice
trail off, hoping Teejay would pick up.</p>

<p>"Where in Virginia?" Teejay asked.</p>

<p>"Northern Virginia. Someplace called McLean."</p>

<p>"Prove it."</p>

<p>"We got a telephone trace, but it hasn't been officially
released. We don't have a search warrant, but there's no doubt it's
from McLean."<a id="p122" name="p122"></a></p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Standard techniques I picked up in graduate school," I said. If I
told him how, he wouldn't believe me. Anyway, he'd never reveal his
methods to me.</p>

<p>"What else do you know about this McLean connection?"</p>

<p>"A little bit. Know any defense contractors there?" For once I
played cat and mouse.</p>

<p>"Cut the crap. Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Mitre."</p>

<p>"Come on. Be serious."</p>

<p>"Would you believe 1820 Dolly Madison Road?"</p>

<p>"Are you trying to tell me that someone from Mitre is hacking into
military computers?"</p>

<p>"That's what our phone trace says."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned. . . . No, it's just not possible." Teejay
went silent for a second. "Mitre's a secure site. . . . Do you know
anything more about this hacker?"</p>

<p>"I know what brand of cigarettes he smokes."</p>

<p>Teejay laughed over the phone. "I guessed that last month."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you tell me?" Teejay wanted my news, but wasn't
forthcoming with his own. "Look, I've got to know one thing. Mitre's a
mile from you. They work on classified projects. Are you sure the
hacker's not with the CIA?"</p>

<p>Teejay became suddenly bureaucratic. "I can only say that nobody in
our agency is authorized to observe domestic activities, with or
without a computer." On the side, he added, "Damned if I know who this
guy is, but he'd better not be one of us."</p>

<p>"Can you find out?"</p>

<p>"Cliff, this is a domestic problem. I'd love to help, but we can't
touch it."</p>

<p>Well, the CIA was interested, but not much help. Time to call the
FBI. For the seventh time, the Oakland FBI office didn't raise an
eyebrow. The agent there seemed more interested in how I traced the
call than in where it led.</p>

<p>Still, there was one more place to call. The Defense Communications
Agency. They seemed to be on good terms with the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations&#8212;maybe they could scare up some official
interest.<a id="p123" name="p123"></a></p>

<p>Despite ten thousand computers on the Milnet, only one person
managed security. A month ago, Major Steve Rudd had asked about our
problems. He hadn't promised any action, just wanted to hear any
news. Maybe the word Mitre would wake him up.</p>

<p>I called him, and mentioned that we'd traced things back to McLean,
Virginia. "I hope you're kidding," Steve said.</p>

<p>"No kidding. The hacking's coming from a defense contractor in
McLean."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Can't say till I check with my boss." I wondered if he'd play cat
and mouse.</p>

<p>Despite his protests, I stood my ground. Maybe by keeping quiet, I
could keep him interested. After a few more minutes on the phone, he
gave up, exasperated. "Look, talk to your boss and see if he'll tell
us. We might be able to help if we know who to lean on. Unless you
tell us, though, we can't do much."</p>

<p>While it was fresh in my mind, I typed the day's events into my
logbook. The phone rang, and when I picked it up, a recorded message
was playing: "This phone line is not secured. Do not discuss
classified information." It repeated a couple times, so I hung up. I
didn't know anything classified, and didn't want to.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, the same message came on my phone. By
listening carefully, you could hear where the tape was spliced. I was
just getting into the rhythm of the mechanical voice when an angry
army officer interrupted.</p>

<p>"Hello, is this Doctor Stoll?" People only used titles on me when I
was in trouble. "This is Jim Christy of the OSI."</p>

<p>The Air Force narcs were on the phone. The Defense Communications
Agency must have rung their bell.</p>

<p>The narc had just one question. "Where did you trace the hacker in
Virginia?"</p>

<p>"Uh, I can't tell you. This line isn't secure."</p>

<p>"Be serious."</p>

<p>There wasn't any reason not to tell him. At worst, he'd do
nothing. At best, he might armtwist Mitre into cooperating. So I
explained the traces to Jim Christy, and he seemed surprised, but
satisfied.<a id="p124" name="p124"></a></p>

<p>"I'll call the Virginia FBI," Jim said. "Maybe we can get some
action from our end."</p>

<p>"Then you know something I don't. The Oakland office won't lift a
finger unless there's a million dollars involved."</p>

<p>Jim explained that the FBI offices are pretty much autonomous. What
excites one agent, another won't consider worthwhile. "It's the luck
of the draw. Sometimes you get the elevator ..."</p>

<p>"... and sometimes you get the shaft." I wished him luck, asked him
to keep me posted, and went back to my logbook. Seemed like the rumors
were true. No police agency trusted another. The only way to solve the
problem was to tell everyone who might be able to help. Sooner or
later, someone might take action.</p>

<p>None of us, at that time, would have guessed anything close to the
truth. None of us&#8212;not the CIA, not the FBI, not the NSA, and
certainly not me&#8212;knew where this twisted path would lead.</p>

<h3>24</h3>

<p class="first">The next morning I arrived at the lab to find nothing
more than a couple stale phone messages. My boss wanted me to call our
funding agency, the Department of Energy&#8212;"Give them a heads-up."
And Dan Kolkowitz called from Stanford.</p>

<p>"I would have sent you electronic mail," Dan said, "but I'm worried
that someone else might read it." We both had learned that hackers
scan electronic mail. The simple solution was to use the phone.</p>

<p>In between bites of a cashew-butter sandwich, I told Dan about my
traces to Mitre, omitting any mention of the CIA. No need to start
rumors about someone in Berkeley cooperating with Big Brother.</p>

<p>Dan took it all in. "Strange. I called you to say that we've just
traced our hacker into Virginia. McLean."</p>

<p>My tongue stuck to my mouth&#8212;maybe it was
cashew-butter&#8212;and it took a moment to talk. "But your hacker's
not the same guy that I'm following."<a id="p125" name="p125"></a></p>

<p>"Yeah. Maybe a group of hackers are using the same methods to
attack different computers. In any case, I know the name of the hacker
that's breaking into Stanford."</p>

<p>"How'd you get that?"</p>

<p>"Simple. We did the same thing as you: printed out everything the
hacker typed. Well, one night, the hacker logged into our Stanford
Unix computer and tried to solve his homework. It was a simple
calculus problem, solving the area under a curve by counting
squares. But the hacker loaded the entire problem into our computer,
including his name and his instructor's name."</p>

<p>"Ha! So who is he?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure. I know his name is Knute Sears. He's in the fourth
period math class, taught by a Mr. Maher. But I haven't any idea where
he is. I've searched the phone books in Stanford, and I can't find
him."</p>

<p>Dan and I both realized that his hacker must be a high school
student. Finding the area under a curve is introductory calculus.</p>

<p>"So how do you find a high school student named Sears?" Dan
asked. "Ever heard of a directory of all kids in high school?"</p>

<p>"No, but maybe there's a directory of high school math teachers."
There's a directory of everyone else, I figured.</p>

<p>We compared our logs, and again decided that we were following two
different people. Perhaps Knute Sears did know the hacker that was
breaking into my system, but they certainly weren't the same guy.</p>

<p>After I hung up, I hopped on my bike and coasted down to
campus. Surely the University library would have a directory of high
school teachers. No luck. Finding an individual isn't easy when you
know their name but not their city.</p>

<p>As a last straw, I could call my sister, Jeannie, in Virginia. Life
was a little zooey for her. What was it like, from my sister's
perspective, to be sucked into this ever-widening vortex of
computo-crud?</p>

<p>All I needed at first was a little telephone work. I'd be most
appreciative if she could call around the Me Lean area high schools to
try and locate the mystery math teacher, Mr. Maher. Compared to the
FBI's foot-dragging, any help<a id="p126" name="p126"></a> on the East
Coast, no matter how minor, would amount to a substantial
dragnet. Furthermore, Jeannie had experience with the Department of
Defense&#8212;well, anyone was more experienced with the military than
me. I trusted Jeannie's discretion; even if she did no more than just
listen, it would be a service.</p>

<p>I phoned Jeannie at work and launched into the requisite background
explanation, but as soon as I dropped the words "hacker" and "Milnet,"
she said, "Okay, what do you want from me?" It turned out that the
Navy research and development center she worked for had warned its
support staff about the risks of leaky computers.</p>

<p>Jeannie did attach one thin string to her offer of help. "It would
be real sweet if you could get someone to write me a nice, official
thank-you note. Say, from the OSI or the FBI, or whoever."</p>

<p>When I next spoke to the OSI, I relayed Jeannie's request. They
assured me that this was easy for them. . . . "We're really good at
writing notes." (Hardly. Despite abundant promises in the next year,
from majors, colonels and generals, my sister was never to receive her
official pat on the back. Eventually, we concluded that it's just not
possible for someone in one part of the federal bureaucracy to
officially thank someone in another.)</p>

<p>At any rate, Jeannie decided to start her investigation during her
lunch break. And she called back with something to report within an
hour.</p>

<p>"The public high school that's closest to Mitre is McLean High
School, so I started there," she said. "I asked to talk to a math
teacher named Mr. Maher. They repeated the name, said, 'One moment
please,' and connected me to someone. At that point, I hung up."</p>

<p>Could it have been that my sister, in one phone call, had gotten
more done than the FBI? Gee, maybe I should impose on her
further. "How about dropping by that school and see if you can spot
any computers&#8212;most schools have 'em. Also, see if you can find
Knute Sears in their yearbook. But be careful. The way I've got him
scoped, he's extremely skittish. Don't spook the guy."</p>

<p>"Okey doke, I'll take a long lunch tomorrow."</p>

<p>The next day, while I pedaled the verdant hills of
Berkeley,<a id="p127" name="p127"></a> my sister circumnavigated the
Washington, D.C., belt-way, feeling alternately exhilarated and
foolish.</p>

<p>It turns out that McLean is the home of loads of elected officials,
policymakers, and upper-end military leaders. Jeannie reports that it
looks like the "apotheosis of the affluent second-ring suburb," though
I'm not sure what that means.</p>

<p>And on that bright Virginia autumn day, its high school seemed a
distillation of all the myths surrounding the Great American High
School. Classes had just let out. Expensively dressed kids spilled out
of the front door. The student parking lot included Mercedes, BMWs,
and an occasional Volvo. Jeannie's pride and joy, a beat-up "81 Chevy
Citation, shrank to the remote outskirts of the lot in self-conscious
mortification.</p>

<p>Jeannie reported that, like her car, she felt discomfort, not to
mention an attack of absurdity, snooping around a suburban school.</p>

<p>Now, my sister has better reason than most to hate being in a high
school. In her younger and more vulnerable years, she taught
eleventh-grade English. Now, teenagers give her the hives, especially
teenagers that don't belong to her. Really affluent ones are the
worst, she reports.</p>

<p>Under the guise of a concerned parent, Jeannie visited the school
office and sat for half an hour, scanning yearbook listings of the
swim team, the Latin scholars, the debaters, for just one mention of
the apocryphal Knute Sears. No dice.</p>

<p>Having thoroughly exhausted the resource material and convinced
that there was no Knute at McLean, she turned her attention to the
teachers' mailboxes. Sure enough, one was labeled "Mr. Maher."</p>

<p>Abruptly, a clerk appeared and asked what she wanted to see. With a
ditsiness reminiscent of Gracie Alien, my sister burbled, "Gee, I
don't know, dear. . . . Well, well, what do you know? Here it is,
right in front of my eyes." The clerk smiled patronizingly as Jeannie
grabbed a brochure from the nearest pile on the counter&#8212;it
turned out to explain how to register for night school. Half covering
a silly-me smirk with her hand, she waved bye-bye with the other hand
and booked out of there.</p>

<p>Her covert operation complete, Jeannie called me that<a id="p128"
name="p128"></a> afternoon. Stanford's mythical Knute Sears was to
remain a myth. He'd never registered at McLean High School. And their
Mr. Maher wasn't a math teacher. He taught history, part time.</p>

<p>Another dead end. Even today, I can't talk to my sister without
feeling acute embarrassment for sending her on a wild-goose chase.</p>

<p>I called Dan at Stanford with the bad news. He wasn't
surprised. "It'll take a long investigation. We're giving up on the
FBI. The Secret Service has a computer crime division that's eager to
work on the case."</p>

<p>The Secret Service was helping Stanford? Weren't they the people
that caught counterfeiters and protected the president?</p>

<p>"Yes," Dan said, "but they also investigate computer crimes. The
Department of the Treasury tries to protect banks from computer fraud,
and the Secret Service is a branch of the Treasury Department."</p>

<p>Dan had found a way around a recalcitrant FBI. "They don't know
much about computers, but they've got moxie. We'll provide the
computer expertise, and they'll get the warrants." Moxie?</p>

<p>It was too late for me, though. Our local FBI still didn't care,
but the FBI office in Alexandria, Virginia, had
noticed. Someone&#8212;Mitre, the Air Force, or the CIA&#8212;had
leaned on them, and Special Agent Mike Gibbons called.</p>

<p>In a couple minutes, I realized that at last I was speaking to an
FBI agent who knew computers. He'd written Unix programs, used modems,
and wasn't scared by databases and word processors. His latest hobby
was playing Dungeons and Dragons on his Atari computer. J. Edgar
Hoover must be rolling in his grave.</p>

<p>Better yet, Mike didn't mind communicating by electronic mail,
although since anyone might intercept our traffic we used an
encryption scheme to keep our conversations private.</p>

<p>From his voice, I guessed Mike wasn't over thirty, but he knew
computer law thoroughly. "There's at least a violation of U.S. Code
Section 1030. Probably breaking and entering as well. When we find
him, he'll be looking at five years or $50,000." I liked how Mike said
"when" rather than "if."<a id="p129" name="p129"></a></p>

<p>I explained my agreement with Mitre. "When the hacker next shows up
in Berkeley, Bill Chandler will trace Mitre's network from the
inside. We'll find him then."</p>

<p>Mike wasn't so sure, but at least he didn't object to my plan. The
only missing piece was the hacker: he hadn't shown up since
Halloween&#8212;a two-week hiatus. Each morning, I'd check the
recorders. Day and night, I'd wear my beeper, waiting for the hacker
to step on our invisible tripwire. But not a peep.</p>

<p>Finally, on November 18, my hacker returned to his Sventek
account. He entered at 8:11 in the morning and stayed around for half
an hour. Immediately, I called Mitre in McLean. Bill Chandler wasn't
in, and a stuffy manager told me that only Bill Chandler was
authorized to trace Mitre's internal network. He talked about "strict
guidelines" and "certified secure networks." I cut him off. With the
hacker live on my system, I didn't need to listen to some big-shot
manager. Where were the technicians, the people who actually knew how
Mitre's system worked?</p>

<p>Another chance to catch the hacker&#8212;foiled.</p>

<p>He showed up again in the afternoon. This time I got through to
Bill Chandler, and he ran over to check his outbound modems. Sure
enough, someone had dialed out through Mitre's modem, and it looked
like a long-distance call. But where was the connection
originating?</p>

<p>Bill explained, "Our network within Mitre is complex, and it's not
easy to trace. We don't have individual wires connecting one computer
to another. Instead, a lot of signals travel on a single wire, and
connections have to be traced by decoding the addresses of each packet
on our ethernet."</p>

<p>In other words, Mitre couldn't trace the calls.</p>

<p>Damn. Someone was calling out from Mitre, but they couldn't find
where the hacker was coming from. We still didn't know if it was a
Mitre employee or someone from the outside.</p>

<p>Furious, I looked over the printout from the hacker. Nothing new
there. He tried once again to slip into the Army base in Anniston but
was turned away. The rest of the time he spent searching my Berkeley
computer for words like "nuclear bomb," and "SDI."<a id="p130"
name="p130"></a> Bill promised to get his best technicians on the
problem. A few days later, when the hacker showed up, I heard the same
story. No doubt that someone was dialing out from Mitre's computer
system. But they couldn't trace it. They were baffled. Who was behind
it? And where was he hiding?</p>

<p>On Saturday, Martha dragged me on a day's outing to Calistoga,
where the geysers and hot springs attract butterflies, geologists, and
hedonists. For the latter, there are mud baths, said to be the height
of Northern California decadence. For twenty dollars, you can be
parboiled in an ooze of volcanic ash, peat, and mineral water.</p>

<p>"It'll take your mind off your work," Martha said. "You've been all
twisted up over this hacker&#8212;a break will do you good." Mired in
an oversized bathtub didn't sound like a recipe for rejuvenation, but
I'll try anything once.</p>

<p>Wallowing in this private swamp, my mind drifted off to thoughts of
Mitre. My hacker used Mitre's outgoing telephone lines to cross the
country. Stanford had traced one hacker to McLean; likely he came
through Mitre. Maybe Mitre provided a central point for hackers, a
sort of switchboard to place their calls. That would mean the hackers
weren't Mitre employees, but were from outside the company.</p>

<p>How could this happen? Mitre would have to make three
mistakes. They'd have to create a way for anyone to connect freely to
their local network. Then, they'd have to allow a stranger to log onto
their computer. Finally, they'd have to provide unaudited outgoing
long-distance telephone service.</p>

<p>They'd met the third condition: the modems connected to their
internal network could call all over the country. We'd traced our
troubles into those very lines.</p>

<p>But how could someone connect into Mitre? Surely they wouldn't
allow just anyone to dial into their network. As Bill Chandler had
said, they're running a secure shop. Military secrets and stuff like
that.</p>

<p>What other ways could you get into Mitre? Over some network,
perhaps? Could a hacker get there through Tymnet? If Mitre paid for
Tymnet service and didn't protect it with passwords, you could call
them from anywhere for free. Once connected, Mitre's internal network
might let you<a id="p131" name="p131"></a> turn around and call
out. Then you could dial anywhere, with Mitre picking up the tab.</p>

<p>It would be easy to test my hypothesis: I'd become a hacker. I'd go
home and try to use Tymnet to connect to Mitre, trying to break into a
place I wasn't supposed to be.</p>

<p>The mud smelled of sulfur and peat moss, and felt like a hot
primordial ooze. I enjoyed the mud bath and the sauna that came
afterward, but I still couldn't wait to get out of the mud and return
home. I had a lead. Or at least a hunch.</p>

<h3>25</h3>

<p class="first">Logbook, Sunday, November 23, 1986</p>

<p>10:30 a.m. Oakland Tymnet access number is 415/430-2900. Called
from my Macintosh at home. 1200 baud, no parity. Tymnet asked for a
username. I entered <em>MITRE.</em> Response: <em>Welcome to
Mitre-Bedford.</em></p>

<p>10:40 A.M. Mitre has an internal network which gives a
menu. Fourteen choices, apparently different computers within Mitre. I
try each in succession.</p>

<p>10:52 a.m. One choice, <em>MWCC</em> leads to another menu. That
menu has twelve choices. One choice is <em>DIAL.</em> I try:</p>

<p><em>DIAL 415 486 2984</em> no effect</p>

<p><em>DIAL 1 415 486 2984</em> no effect</p>

<p><em>DIAL 9 1 415 486 2984</em> Connected into Berkeley
computer.</p>

<p>Conclusion: An outsider can connect into Mitre through Tymnet. No
password necessary. Once in Mitre, they can dial out, either locally
or long distance.</p>

<p>MWCC means "Mitre Washington Computing Center"; Bedford means
"Bedford Massachusetts." I'd entered Mitre in Bedford, and popped out
five hundred miles away in McLean.</p>

<p>11:03 a.m. Disconnect from Berkeley computer, but remain at
Mitre. I request connection into system AEROVAX. It prompts for
username. I enter "Guest." It accepts and logs me in, without any
password. Explore Aerovax computer.</p>

<p>Aerovax has programs for some sort of airport flight
safety. Program to find allowable landing angles for high-<a id="p132"
name="p132"></a>speed and low-speed aircraft approaches. Presumably
funded by government contracts.</p>

<p>Aerovax connects to several other computers over Mitre's
network. These are password protected. "Guest" is not a valid username
on these other Mitre computers. (I'm not sure they're even at
Mitre.)</p>

<p>Wait&#8212;something's wrong here. The network controlling software
doesn't seem normal&#8212;its greeting message shows up too quickly,
but it completes its connection too slowly. I wonder what's in that
program. . . .</p>

<p>Aha! It's been modified. Someone has set a Trojan horse in the
Aerovax network software. It copies network passwords into a secret
file for later use.</p>

<p>Conclusion: someone's been tampering with Mitre's software,
successfully stealing passwords.</p>

<p>11:35 a.m. Disconnect from Mitre and update logbook.</p>

<p>Today, reading my logbook, I remember an hour of poking around
Mitre's internal network. At once it felt exciting and forbidden. Any
minute, I expected someone to send a message on my computer screen,
"We caught you. Come out with your hands up."</p>

<p>No doubt Mitre had left a gaping hole in their system. Anyone could
make a local telephone call, tell Tymnet to connect to Mitre, and
spend an afternoon fooling around with Mitre's computers. Most of
their machines were protected with passwords, but at least one was
pretty much wide open.</p>

<p>I remembered Mitre's pious disclaimer, "We're running a secure
shop, and nobody can break in." Right.</p>

<p>The "Guest" account on their Aerovax let anyone on. But the Trojan
horse was deadly. Someone had tampered with their network program to
copy passwords into a special area. Every time a legitimate employee
used the Aerovax computer, her password was stolen. This gave the
hacker keys to other Mitre computers. Once the hacker penetrated their
armor, he could roam anywhere.</p>

<p>How deeply was Mitre's system infested? By listing their directory,
I saw that the Trojan horse was dated June 17. For six months, someone
had silently booby-trapped their computers.</p>

<p>I couldn't prove that it was the same hacker that I was<a id="p133"
name="p133"></a> dealing with. But this morning's exercises showed
that anyone could enter Mitre's system and dial into my Berkeley
computers. So the hacker wasn't necessarily at Mitre. He might be
anywhere.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, Mitre served as a way station, a stepping stone
on the way to breaking into other computers.</p>

<p>The McLean connection became clear. Someone dialed into Mitre, and
turned around and dialed out from them. This way, Mitre paid the bills
both ways: the incoming Tymnet connection and the outgoing
long-distance telephone call. Even nicer, Mitre served as a hiding
place, a hole in the wall that couldn't be traced.</p>

<p>Mitre, the high-security defense contractor&#8212;I'd been told
that you can't get past their lobby without showing picture ID. Their
guards wear guns, and their fences are barbed. Yet all it takes is a
home computer and a telephone to prowl through their databases.</p>

<p>Monday morning, I called Bill Chandler at Mitre and told him the
news. I didn't expect him to believe me, so I wasn't disappointed to
hear him insist that his company was "highly secured and sensitive to
any security problems."</p>

<p>I'd heard it before. "If you're so concerned about security, why
isn't anyone auditing your computers?"</p>

<p>"We do. We keep detailed records of how each computer's used," Bill
said. "But that's for accounting, not to detect hackers." I wondered
what his people would do about a 75-cent accounting error.</p>

<p>"Ever hear about a system called the Aerovax?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, what about it?"</p>

<p>"Just wondering. Hold any classified data?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know. It's for an airport control system. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just wondering. You ought to check it over, though." I
couldn't admit that I'd danced through his system yesterday,
discovering the Trojan horse. "Know any way for a hacker to enter your
system?"</p>

<p>"It had better be impossible."</p>

<p>"You might check out your public access dial in ports. While you're
at it, try accessing Mitre's computers over Tymnet. Anyone can connect
to your system, from anywhere."<a id="p134" name="p134"></a></p>

<p>This latest news woke him up to some serious problems in his
system. Mitre wasn't inept. Just semi-ept.</p>

<p>Bill wasn't sure how to react, but he wouldn't keep his system open
any longer. I couldn't blame him. His computers were naked.</p>

<p>Mostly, he wanted me to keep my mouth shut.</p>

<p>I'd shut up, all right, on one condition. For months, Mitre's
computers had called around the country, using expensive, AT&amp;T
long-distance telephone lines. There must be phone bills for those
calls.</p>

<p>In Berkeley, five of us shared a house. We had a monthly dinner
party when the phone bill arrived. With poker faces, each of us would
deny making <em>any</em> of the calls. But somehow, eventually, every
call was accounted for, and the bill paid.</p>

<p>If the five of us could haggle through a phone bill, Mitre must be
able to as well. I asked Bill Chandler, "Who pays the phone bills for
your computer?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," he replied. "Probably central accounting. I never
see them."</p>

<p>That's how the hacker got away with it for so long. The people
paying the phone bills never talked to the managers of the
computers. Strange. Or was it typical? The computer's modems run up a
long-distance phone bill. The phone company sends the bill to Mitre,
and some faceless accountant signs a check. Nobody closes the
loop. Nobody asks about the legitimacy of those dozens of calls to
Berkeley.</p>

<p>Bill wanted me to be quiet about these problems. Well, yes, but I
had a price. "Say, Bill, could you send me copies of your computer's
phone bills?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"It might be fun to see where else this hacker got into."</p>

<p>Two weeks later, a thick envelope arrived, stuffed with
long-distance bills from Chesapeake and Potomac.</p>

<p>At home, my housemates and I haggled over a twenty-dollar phone
bill. But I'd never seen thousand-dollar bills. Every month, Mitre had
paid for hundreds of long-distance calls, all over North America.</p>

<p>But these weren't people reaching out to touch each other. These
bills showed Mitre's computer dialing hundreds of other computers. (I
proved this to myself by calling<a id="p135" name="p135"></a> a
few. Sure enough, in each case, I heard a modem answer with a
whistle.)</p>

<p>Now here's some useful information. Mitre might not be interested
in analyzing it, but together with my logbook, I might be able to
understand how far the hacker had penetrated. I'd just have to somehow
separate the hacker's calls from the normal calls.</p>

<p>Plenty of the calls were obvious hacking. On the list were lots of
calls to Anniston, Alabama. And there were the calls to Tymnet in
Oakland&#8212;they'd cost me a galaxy to trace.</p>

<p>But some of the calls on the bills must be legitimate. After all,
Mitre's employees must call computers to transfer data or copy the
latest software from the West Coast. How could I separate the hacker's
calls?</p>

<p>Back home, when our phone bill arrived, Martha cooked up dinner,
Claudia did the salad, and I baked cookies.<a href="#fn136"
id="ret136" name="ret136">[*]</a> Afterward, stuffed on chocolate
chips, we'd divvy up the phone bill.</p>

<p>Sitting around the dining table, my housemates and I had no problem
figuring out who'd made which long-distance calls on our bill. If I
had made a call to Buffalo from 9:30 until 9:35 and another to
Baltimore from 9:35 to 9:45, then it was likely that I'd made the call
to New York from 9:46 to 9:52.</p>

<p>Looking at Mitre's phone bills, I knew that only the hacker would
call the Army base in Anniston, Alabama. Pretty likely that a phone
call made a minute after calling Anniston belonged to the hacker. Same
for a call that ended just before dialing Alabama.</p>

<p>In physics, this is correlation analysis. If you see a solar flare
today and tonight there's a bright aurora, chances are that these are
correlated. You look at things that occur close together in time, and
try to find the probability that they're somehow connected.</p>

<p>Correlation analysis in physics is simply common sense.<a id="p136"
name="p136"></a></p>

<p>Well, here were six months of phone bills. Dates, times, phone
numbers, and cities. Probably five thousand in all. Enough that I
couldn't analyze it by hand. Perfect for analyzing on a
computer&#8212;there's plenty of software written to search out
correlations. All I had to do was enter them into my Macintosh
computer and run a few programs.</p>

<p>Ever type five thousand phone numbers? It's as boring as it
sounds. And I had to do it twice, to make sure I didn't make any
mistakes. Took me two days.</p>

<p>Two days to enter the data, and an hour to analyze it. I told my
program to assume that the hacker made all calls to the Anniston Army
base. Find all calls that immediately preceded or trailed those
calls. It took a minute, and showed me that the hacker had called
Oakland's Tymnet many times. Aah, the program behaved reasonably.</p>

<p>I spent the afternoon tinkering with the program, refining its
statistical techniques and watching the effect of different algorithms
on the output. It determined the probability that each call was made
by the hacker. Cute&#8212;just the thing to settle arguments at
home.</p>

<p>It wasn't until the evening that I realized what the program was
telling me: this hacker hadn't just broken into my computer. He was
into more than six, and possibly a dozen.</p>

<p>From Mitre, the hacker had made long-distance connections to
Norfolk, Oak Ridge, Omaha, San Diego, Pasadena, Livermore, and
Atlanta.</p>

<p>At least as interesting: he had made hundreds of one-minute-long
phone calls, all across the country, to Air Force bases, Navy
shipyards, aircraft builders, and defense contractors. What can you
learn from a one-minute phone call to an Army proving ground?</p>

<p>For six months, this hacker had broken into Air Force bases and
computers all across the country. Nobody knew it. He was out there,
alone, silent, anonymous, persistent, and apparently
successful&#8212;but why? What's he after? What's he already learned?
And what's he doing with this information?<a id="p137"
name="p137"></a></p>

<h3>26</h3>

<p class="first">Mitre's phone bills showed hundreds of telephone
calls all around lire country, most of them a minute or two long. But
no human voice spoke over that line&#8212;it was one computer dialing
another.</p>

<p>My boss's voice, though, was singularly human. Around the end of
November, Roy Kerth stopped in my office, and found me asleep under my
desk.</p>

<p>"Whacha been doing for the past month?"</p>

<p>I could hardly say, "Oh, typing in phone bills from some East Coast
defense contractor." Reminding him of my chase would jog his memory of
a three-week limit. Quickly, I thought of our department's new
graphics terminal&#8212;a spiffy new toy that displays
three-dimensional images of mechanical devices. I'd fiddled with it
for an hour, just long enough to learn how difficult it was to
use. But it was an excuse to get the boss off my back, and I told him,
"Oh, I'm helping some astronomers design their telescope with our new
display terminal." This wasn't a total lie, since we'd talked about
doing this. For all of five minutes.</p>

<p>My maneuver backfired. Roy smiled slyly and said, "OK. Next week
show us some pretty pictures."</p>

<p>By never showing up before noon, I'd managed to avoid half of the
department's meetings. If I didn't have something by next week, no
doubt my wings would get clipped.</p>

<p>Time to slide the hacker onto the back burner&#8212;and just as the
trail was heating up.</p>

<p>One week to learn how to program the beast, figure out what the
astronomers needed, and get something on the screen. I knew zero about
computerized design. And the programming language was from the
twenty-first century: it claimed to be "an object-oriented language
with graphical inheritance." Whatever that meant.</p>

<p>So I wandered over to the telescope design team, where Jerry Nelson
and Terry Mast were arguing over how much their telescope would bend
due to gravity. When looking at<a id="p138" name="p138"></a> stars
straight overhead, gravity wouldn't bend the telescope tube. But when
pointing near the horizon, the tube would bow slightly. Just enough to
upset the delicate optical alignment. They wanted to know how much,
and could I show the effect on the computer.</p>

<p>This seemed like fun&#8212;at least more fun than figuring out what
"graphical inheritance" meant. We talked for a while, and Jerry
mentioned that Professor Erik Antonsson had written a program to
display the telescope on a graphics display terminal. The same type as
I was supposed to program.</p>

<p>"You mean that someone has already written the program to solve
your problem and display a picture on the screen?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," the astronomer explained. "But it's down at Caltech in
Pasadena. Doesn't do us much good four hundred miles away. We need the
results now."</p>

<p>I just had to get the Caltech program up to Berkeley and fit it
into my Vax computer. No need to even figure out how to program the
beast.</p>

<p>I called Professor Antonsson at Caltech. He'd be happy if we used
his program, but how would he send it to us? Mail would take a
week. Faster to send it electronically. Aah&#8212; when you need a
program, don't mail a tape. Just ship it over the network. In twenty
minutes, the program percolated across the wires, and settled into my
computer.</p>

<p>Well, Professor Antonsson had done a super job of programming the
problem. By nine that evening, I'd customized his program for my
system and the new telescope data.</p>

<p>Amazingly, the damn thing worked, though not quite the first
time. By 2 a.m., I got it to draw a multicolored picture of the Keck
Telescope, complete with struts, bearings, and mirrors. You could see
where the tube bent, where the stresses built up, and which sections
needed reinforcing. Technology conies through again.</p>

<p>One evening of real work, and I was off the hook. The hacker was
back on the front burner.</p>

<p>But not a peep from him. My alarms were set, the monitors active,
but he'd been invisible for two weeks. On my way home, I wondered if
he too might have an urgent<a id="p139" name="p139"></a> project that
kept him away from my computer. Or had he found a new way to enter the
Milnet, completely bypassing my traps?</p>

<p>As usual, I slept late the next morning. (No need to work early
when Thanksgiving weekend was coming up.) At 11:30, I pedaled up the
hill and ducked into work, ready to show off my zero-work computer
display. But once in my office, I went back to wondering why the
hacker wasn't showing up. Time to call Mitre, and find out what they'd
done.</p>

<p>Bill Chandler's voice crackled through a noisy long-distance
connection. Yes, a week ago, he'd disconnected their outgoing
modems. The hacker could no longer leapfrog through Mitre's local
network.</p>

<p>The gig was up. We didn't know where he came from, and we'd never
find out. Since Mitre had corked up their hole, the hacker would have
to find another path into my system.</p>

<p>Not likely. If someone had bolted my door shut, I'd be suspicious
that they were about to bust me. And I knew this hacker was
paranoid. He'd disappear for sure.</p>

<p>So all my traps had been set in vain. The hacker was gone, and I'd
never find out who he was. Three months of searching, with only a
fuzzy question mark at the end.</p>

<p>Not that I should complain. Without a hacker to occupy my time,
there was plenty of worthwhile work waiting. Like designing a
telescope. Or managing a computer. And building scientific
software. Jeez&#8212;I might even do something useful.</p>

<p>But I'd miss the excitement. Running down the hallway and jumping
to a printer. Crowding around a computer screen, trying to trace
connections through my computer out somewhere across the country.</p>

<p>And I'd miss the satisfaction of building tools with which to
follow him. By now, my programs were almost instant. Seconds after the
hacker touched my computer, my pocket pager beeped. It didn't just
tell me that the hacker was around. I'd programmed my pager to beep in
Morse code, telling me the hacker's target computer, his account name
(usually Sventek), and which line the hacker had entered from. Backup
alarms and monitors made the system fail-safe.<a id="p140"
name="p140"></a></p>

<p>Somewhere out there, a stranger had come close to getting
nailed. If only I'd been able to make one more trace.</p>

<p>Just one more trace.</p>

<p>The hacker was gone, but I had a few loose ends. Mitre's
long-distance phone bills showed dozens of calls to a number in
Norfolk, Virginia. By calling around (standard graduate school
technique: keep pestering), I eventually found that the hacker had
been dialing the Navy Regional Automated Data Center.</p>

<p>Well, nobody's stopping me, so I called the Navy data center and
talked to their system manager, Ray Lynch. Ray seemed to be an
outgoing, competent guy who took his job very seriously. He ran an
electronic mailbox system&#8212; pigeonholes for electronic mail.</p>

<p>Ray reported that back on July 23, from 3:44 until 6:26 P.M.,
someone had broken into his Vax computer, using the account belonging
to the field service engineers. Once inside his system, the hacker had
created a new account named Hunter.</p>

<p>There's that name again. Same guy, no doubt.</p>

<p>The episode normally would have escaped Ray's attention. With three
hundred Navy officers using his computers, he'd never have noticed
someone illegally adding a new account.</p>

<p>But the next day, he received a phone call from Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, California; the same people that run
interplanetary spacecraft. An alert JPL operator had detected a new
system manager at their mail management computer. This new user had
entered from the Milnet, coming in from Virginia.</p>

<p>JPL called Ray Lynch, and asked him why his field service people
had been fooling with their computer. Ray didn't wait around to ask
questions. He shut down his computer and changed all its
passwords. The next day, he reregistered each of his users.</p>

<p>So my hacker had broken into JPL and a Navy computer. Months before
I'd detected him in Berkeley, he had been fooling around the
Milnet.</p>

<p>These targets were news to me. Were they a clue to where the hacker
was? Well, if you live in California, there's no reason to go through
Virginia to reach a computer in<a id="p141" name="p141"></a>
Pasadena. And why would someone in Virginia go through Mitre to dial
another Virginia phone?</p>

<p>Suppose this hacker had used Mitre to dial all his calls, except
for local ones. That meant that any state that showed up on Mitre's
phone bills was not the hacker's home. Ruled out Virginia, California,
Alabama, Texas, Nebraska, and a dozen others. This didn't lead
anywhere, and hardly seemed convincing.</p>

<p>I called some of the other places listed on Mitre's phone
bills. The hacker had hit a college in Atlanta, Georgia. The system
manager there hadn't detected it, but he wasn't likely to, either. "We
run a pretty open system. Lots of students know the system
password. The whole thing depends on trust."</p>

<p>That was one way to run a computer. Leave all the doors open. Like
one of my physics profs: anyone could wander into his office. Didn't
do much good, though. He kept his notes in Chinese.</p>

<p>From talking to Ray, I learned one new wrinkle about the hacker. Up
until now, I'd watched him exploit Unix systems. But Ray's system was
a Vax computer running the VMS operating system. The hacker might not
know the Berkeley variant of Unix, but he certainly knew how to break
into Vax VMS systems.</p>

<p>Since 1978, Digital Equipment Corporation had been making Vaxes,
their first thirty-two-bit computers. They couldn't make them fast
enough: by 1985, over fifty thousand had been sold, at $200,000
each. Most of them used the versatile, friendly VMS operating system,
although some contrary cusses threw away the VMS system, preferring
the power of Unix.</p>

<p>Both Unix and VMS divide up the computer's resources to give a
separate area for every user. There's space reserved for the system
and common space that can be shared by everyone.</p>

<p>Somehow, when you uncrate the machine and first switch it on,
you've got to be able to create places for your users. If the machine
comes to you protected with passwords, you won't be able to log on the
first time.</p>

<p>Digital Equipment Company answered this problem by packaging every
Vax-VMS computer with three accounts,<a id="p142" name="p142"></a>
each with its own password. There's the SYSTEM account, with the
password "MANAGER." An account named FIELD, password "SERVICE." And an
account USER with the password "USER."</p>

<p>The instructions say to start the system running, create new
accounts for your users, and then change these passwords. Starting up
a computer is a bit tricky and, well, some system managers have never
changed these passwords. Despite Digital's best efforts to make the
system managers change those passwords, some never do. The result?
Today, on some systems, you can still log in as SYSTEM, with the
password "MANAGER."</p>

<p>That system account is completely privileged. From it, you can read
any file, run any program, and change any data. Seems nutty to leave
it unprotected.</p>

<p>The hacker either knew about these backdoor passwords, or else he
knew some very subtle bug in the VMS operating system. Either way,
there was little doubt that he was skilled in two operating systems:
Unix and VMS.</p>

<p>Some high school students are impressive computer jockeys. But it's
a rare high school student who's both deeply skilled and
versatile&#8212;experienced in several computers. That takes
time. Years, usually. Yes, most Unix systems folks could exploit the
Gnu-Emacs hole, once they realized its weakness. And most VMS system
managers knew about the not-so-secret default passwords. But each
operating system took a couple years to become proficient in, and the
skills weren't very portable.</p>

<p>My hacker had a couple of years of Unix experience, and a couple of
years in VMS. Probably had been system manager or administrator along
the way.</p>

<p>Not a high school student.</p>

<p>But not an experienced wizard, either. He didn't know Berkeley
Unix.</p>

<p>I had been following someone in his twenties who smoked Benson and
Hedges cigarettes. And broke into military computers, searching for
classified information.</p>

<p>But was I following him anymore? No, not really. He wouldn't show
up again.</p>

<p>Teejay called from the CIA. "I'm just checking to hear what's new
about our boy."<a id="p143" name="p143"></a></p>

<p>"No, nothing really. I think I know how old he is, but not a whole
lot." I started explaining about the Navy data center and the backdoor
passwords, but then the CIA agent interrupted.</p>

<p>"Got printouts of those sessions?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, my direct evidence is Mitre's phone bills. If that's not
convincing, there's other pointers. He created an account with the
name Hunter. Same as at Anniston."</p>

<p>"Did you write this in your logbook?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I put everything there."</p>

<p>"Could you send me a copy?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's kinda private. . . ." Teejay wouldn't send me copies
of <em>his</em> reports.</p>

<p>"Come on, be serious. If we're ever going to light a fire under the
&#8216;F' entity, I've got to know what's happening."</p>

<p>The "F" entity? I searched my memory. Fourier transform? Fossils?
Finger painting?</p>

<p>"What's the 'F' entity?" I asked, somewhat humiliated.</p>

<p>"You know, the entity in Washington," Teejay replied with a touch
of annoyance. "J. Edgar's boys. The Bureau."</p>

<p>Why not just say the FBI?</p>

<p>"Oh, I get it, you want my logbook to convince the 'F' entity to do
something." Entity, indeed. Spooktalk.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Just send it to me."</p>

<p>"What's your address?" "Just mail it to Teejay, Zip Code
20505. It'll reach me."</p>

<p>Now there's status. No last name, no street, no city, no state. I
wondered if he ever got junk mail.</p>

<p>With the CIA off my neck, I might as well go back to real work. I
played around with Professor Antonsson's graphics program for a while,
and found that it was amazingly simple to understand. All this hype
about object-oriented programming just meant that you didn't write
programs using variables and data structures; instead, you told the
computer about things. To describe a robot, you'd detail its feet,
legs, joints, torso, and head. No need to talk about X's and Y's. And
"graphical inheritance" just meant that when the robot moved its leg,
the feet and toes moved automatically. You didn't have to write a
separate program to move each object.</p>

<p>Neat. After a day or two of fooling with the Caltech<a id="p144"
name="p144"></a> program, its simplicity and elegance came shining
through. What seemed a hairy programming challenge turned out to be
easy. So I spiffed up the display, adding colors and titles. The boss
wanted me to jump through hoops; I'd put up a three-ring circus.</p>

<h3>27</h3>

<p class="first">Thanksgiving would be a corker. With her bicycle and
backpack, Martha had hauled home forty pounds of groceries. She made
only a few sarcastic comments about roommates who sleep late, and set
me to putting stuff away and cleaning the house.</p>

<p>"Put away the veggies, honey," she said. "I'm going to the
Safeway." How could there possibly be more food to get? Seeing my
amazement, she explained that this was just the fresh stuff, and she
still had to get the goose, flour, butter, cream, and eggs. A corker,
for sure.</p>

<p>I put the food away and climbed back in bed. I woke up to the smell
of biscuits and goose wafting through the house. We expected Martha's
grad school friends who couldn't go home (or preferred Martha's
cooking to mom's), a couple of law professors, a few hungry warriors
from her aikido dojo, and her zany friend Laurie. My conscience
finally responded to all Martha's bustling, and I revved up our
250-horsepower Hoover.</p>

<p>As I vacuumed the room, our roommate Claudia returned from a violin
rehearsal. "Oh, don't do that," she exclaimed, "that's my job."
Imagine&#8212;a roommate that enjoyed doing housework. Her only fault
was playing late-night Mozart.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving passed by idyllically, with friends wandering in,
helping in the kitchen, talking, and lounging around. It was an
all-day feed, starting with fresh oysters from the San Francisco
wharf, moving on leisurely to Martha's wild mushroom soup, then the
goose. Then we lay around like beached whales until we worked up the
energy to take a short walk. Over pie and herbal tea, the talk turned
to law, and Martha's friend Vicky held forth on
environmental<a id="p145" name="p145"></a> regulation while a couple
of professors argued over affirmative action.</p>

<p>Finally, too full and contented for intelligent conversation, we
lay in front of the fire and roasted chestnuts. Vicky and Claudia
played piano duets; Laurie sang a ballad, and I thought about planets
and galaxies. Worries about computer networks and spies seemed unreal
in this warm world of friends, food, and music. A down-home
Thanksgiving in Berkeley.</p>

<p>At the lab, I forgot about the hacker. He'd been gone for almost a
month. Why? I didn't know.</p>

<p>The astronomers fiddled with their new graphics display, studying
ways to strengthen their telescope. By now, I'd figured out how to
animate the display, so they could zoom in on interesting parts, and
rotate it on the screen. Object-oriented programming&#8212;by
accident, I'd learned a new buzzword. The astronomers didn't care, but
I had to give a talk to computer folks.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I was all set to dazzle the other systems folks. I'd
memorized all the jargon and set up the display so that it wouldn't
foul up at the last minute.</p>

<p>A dozen computer whizzes showed up at three o'clock. The display
system worked flawlessly, and the Caltech software loaded without a
hitch. Computer people are accustomed to boring talks on databases and
structured programming, so this three-dimensional color graphics
display amazed them all.</p>

<p>Twenty-five minutes into the show, I was answering a question about
the programming language ("It's object oriented, whatever that means
. . .") when my pocket pager beeped.</p>

<p>Three beeps. Morse code for the letter S. S for Sventek. The hacker
had connected to our system on the Sventek account.</p>

<p>Damn. A month of quiet, and the SOB shows up now.</p>

<p>Well, the show must go on. I couldn't acknowledge that I was still
chasing the hacker&#8212;my three-week allowance had long ago been
used up. But I had to get over to the monitoring post and watch what
he was doing.</p>

<p>Of course. I stopped showing pretty pictures and began describing
an obscure area of galactic astronomy. It took five minutes, but
people began to squirm and yawn. My<a id="p146" name="p146"></a> boss
looked at his watch, and ended the meeting. Another application for
advanced astronomy.</p>

<p>I dodged the gang in the hallway, and slipped into the
switchyard. The hacker wasn't active on any of my monitors.</p>

<p>He'd left his footprints though. The printer showed him here for
two minutes. Long enough to check out our system. He checked that the
system manager wasn't around, then looked for the Gnu-Emacs
hole&#8212;it still hadn't been patched. And he listed his four stolen
accounts&#8212;no change there. Then, poof, gone.</p>

<p>No way to trace him after the fact. But the monitor that caught him
was on the Tymnet line. So he was coming in on the same line. Was his
path from Mitre to AT&amp;T to Pacific Bell to Tymnet?</p>

<p>Time to call Mitre. Bill Chandler answered. "No, he couldn't have
used our modems. They're all turned off."</p>

<p>Really? Easy to check. I called Mitre through Tymnet. I could still
reach into Mitre's network, but Bill had indeed shut off his modems. A
hacker could fool with his computers, but couldn't get out. My hacker
had come from somewhere else.</p>

<p>Should I feel elated or despondent? The varmint was back with
super-user privileges. But maybe this time I'd nail the bastard. If he
kept returning to his roost, I'd trace him for sure.</p>

<p>I suppressed my vindictive feelings towards my unseen
adversary. Research was the answer. The question wasn't, "Who's doing
it?" I'd get no satisfaction if a postcard showed up saying, "Joe
Blatz is breaking into your computer."</p>

<p>No, the problem was to build the tools to find who was there. What
if I traced the whole connection, and it turned out to be a red
herring? At least, I'd understand the phenomenon. Not all research
yields exactly the results you expect.</p>

<p>My tools were sharp. The alarms triggered as soon as he entered his
stolen account names. If they failed, a backup program, hidden behind
my Unix-8 computer would detect him within a minute. When the hacker
touched the tripwire, my beeper told me about it instantly.</p>

<p>The hacker could hide, but he couldn't violate physics. Every
connection had to start somewhere. Whenever he showed up, he exposed
himself. I just had to be alert.</p>

<p>The fox was back. This hound was ready for the chase.<a id="p147"
name="p147"></a></p>

<h3>28</h3>

<p class="first">After a month's disappearance, the hacker was back on
my system. Martha wasn't happy about this; she began to see a
mechanical rival in my pocket pager. "How long before you're free from
that electronic leash?"</p>

<p>"Just a couple more weeks. It'll be over by New Year's Day, for
sure." Even after three months of chasing, I still thought I was close
to the end.</p>

<p>I was sure I'd catch him: since the hacker couldn't hide behind
Mitre anymore, the next trace would move us one step closer. He didn't
know it, but he was running out of space. In a few more weeks he'd be
mine.</p>

<p>Friday, December 5, the hacker showed up again at 1:21 in the
afternoon. He raised periscope, looking for our system manager, and
then listed our password file.</p>

<p>This was the second time he'd ripped off my password file. What
for? There's no key to unlock these encrypted passwords: they're just
goulash until they're decrypted. And our encryption software is a
one-way trapdoor: its mathematical scrambling is precise, repeatable,
and irreversible.</p>

<p>Did he know something that I didn't? Did this hacker have a magic
decryption formula? Unlikely. If you turn the crank of a sausage
machine backwards, pigs won't come out the other end.</p>

<p>Four months from now, I'd realize what he was doing, but for now, I
had my hands full trying to trace him.</p>

<p>Nine minutes after he showed up, he disappeared. Enough time for me
to trace the connection to Tymnet. But their network sorcerer, Ron
Vivier, was taking a long lunch. So Tymnet couldn't make the
trace. Another chance lost.</p>

<p>Ron returned my call an hour later. "It was an office party," he
said. "I thought you'd given up on chasing this guy."</p>

<p>I explained the month-long hiatus. "We tracked him into Mitre, and
they plugged the hole he was using. Stopped him for a month, but now
he's back."<a id="p148" name="p148"></a></p>

<p>"Why don't you cork up your hole, too?"</p>

<p>"Guess I ought to," I said, "but we've sunk three months into this
project. We can't be far from solving it."</p>

<p>Ron had been in the middle of every trace. He'd invested plenty of
time, all voluntary. We didn't pay Tymnet to trace hackers.</p>

<p>"Hey, Cliff, how come you never call me at night?" Ron had given me
his home number, but I only called him at his office.</p>

<p>"Guess the hacker doesn't show up at night. I wonder why." He
started me thinking. My logbook recorded every time the hacker had
shown up. On the average, when was he active?</p>

<p>I'd remembered him on at 6 a.m. and at 7 p.m. But never at
midnight. Isn't midnight operation the very image of a hacker?</p>

<p>As of December 6, the hacker had connected to us
one-hundred-thirty-five times. Enough times for a statistical analysis
of his work habits. In a couple of hours, I'd entered all the dates
and times into a program. Now just average them.</p>

<p>Well, not exactly a simple average. What's the average of 6
a.m. and 6 p.m.? Is it noon or midnight? But this is bread and butter
for statistics folks. Dave Cleveland showed me the right program, and
I spent the rest of the day making all sorts of averages.</p>

<p>On the average, the hacker showed up at noon, Pacific time. Because
of daylight savings time, I could stretch this to 12:30 or even 1
p.m., but there was no way that he was an evening person. Though
sometimes he showed up in the morning, and occasionally at night (I
still resented him spoiling Halloween for me!), he generally worked in
the early afternoon. On the average, he stayed connected twenty
minutes. A lot of two- or three-minute connections, and a few two-hour
runs.</p>

<p>So what does this mean? Suppose he lives in California. Then he's
hacking during the day. If he's on the East Coast, he's three hours
ahead of us, so he works around three or four in the afternoon.</p>

<p>This doesn't make sense. He'd work at night to save on
long-distance telephone fees. To avoid network congestion.<a id="p149"
name="p149"></a> And to avoid detection. Yet he brazenly breaks in
during the day. Why?</p>

<p>Confidence? Perhaps. After he made certain that no system operator
was present, he roamed the insides of my computer without
hesitation. Arrogance? Possibly. He was shameless in reading others'
mail and copying their data. But this hardly could account for his
showing up during midday.</p>

<p>Maybe he felt he was less likely to be noticed when dozens of
others were using our computer. Although lots of programs ran at
night, most of these were batch jobs, submitted during the day and
postponed until evening. By midnight, only a couple of night owls were
logged in.</p>

<p>Whatever his reason, this peculiar habit made life slightly easier
for me. Fewer interruptions when sleeping with Martha. Less need to
call the police at night. And a greater chance that I'd be around when
he showed up.</p>

<p>As we chopped onions at the kitchen table, I told Martha about my
results. "I'm tailing a hacker that avoids the dark."</p>

<p>She wasn't impressed. "This doesn't make sense. If the guy's an
amateur, then he'd be breaking in during off-hours."</p>

<p>"So you say he's a professional, keeping regular office hours?" I
could picture someone punching a time card in the morning, spending
eight hours breaking into computers, then punching out.</p>

<p>"No," Martha said, "even professional burglars keep odd hours. What
I want to know is whether his hours change on weekends."</p>

<p>I couldn't answer that one. I'd have to go back to the lab, cull
out all the weekend times, and average them separately.</p>

<p>"But suppose the hacker really only shows up around noon," Martha
continued. "It might be nighttime where he lives."</p>

<p>When it's noon in California, where is it evening? Even astronomers
get confused by time changes, but I know it gets later as you move
east. We're eight hours behind Greenwich, so lunchtime in Berkeley is
bedtime in Europe. Is the hacker coming from Europe?</p>

<p>Improbable, but worth thinking about. A month or two ago, I'd
measured the distance to the hacker by timing<a id="p150"
name="p150"></a> echos when the hacker ran Kermit. What I found didn't
make much sense: the hacker seemed to be around six thousand miles
away.</p>

<p>Made sense now. It's five thousand miles to London. Small
world.</p>

<p>But how do you get from Europe into our networks? Phoning across
the Atlantic would cost a fortune. And why go through Mitre?</p>

<p>I had to keep reminding myself that these were just weak
pointers. Nothing conclusive. But it was hard to fall asleep that
evening. Tomorrow I'd go up to the lab and reread my logbook with a
new hypothesis: the hacker might be coming in from abroad.</p>

<h3>29</h3>

<p class="first">Saturday morning I woke up nestled in Martha's
arms. We fooled around for a while, and I made a batch of my
quasi-stellar waffles&#8212;the ones that are advertised all over the
Andromeda galaxy.</p>

<p>Despite the early hour, I couldn't resist heading over to the
lab. I bicycled along side streets, scanning for yard sales. Right
along the way, someone was selling their household, well preserved
from the 1960s. Rock posters, bell-bottom jeans, even a Nehru
jacket. I picked up a Captain Midnight Secret Decoder Ring for two
dollars. It still had an endorsement for Ovaltine.</p>

<p>At the lab, I started analyzing the hacker's log-in times,
separating out his weekend sessions. It took a while, but I managed to
show that on weekdays he showed up from noon to three p.m.; on
weekends he'd show up as early as six a.m.</p>

<p>Suppose this sneak lived in Europe. He might break in at any hour
on the weekend, but confine himself to evenings during the week. The
log-in times agreed with this, but agreement is hardly proof. A dozen
other theories could satisfy the data.</p>

<p>I'd ignored one source of information. The Usenet is a<a id="p151"
name="p151"></a> nationwide network of thousands of computers, tied
together by telephone links. It's a wide-area electronic bulletin
board, a sort of networked classified newspaper. Anyone can post
notes; every hour, dozens of new messages show up, divided into
categories like Unix Bugs, Macintosh Programs, and Science Fiction
Discussions. There's nobody in charge: any Unix computer can link to
Usenet, and post messages to the rest. Anarchy in action.</p>

<p>System managers post a lot of the messages, so you'll find notes
like, "We have a Foobar model 37 computer, and we're trying to hook up
a Yoyodyne tape to it. Can anyone help?" Often someone will respond,
solving the problem in minutes. Other times, it's a lone voice in an
electronic wilderness.</p>

<p>I couldn't post a note saying, "Hackers are breaking into my
computer. Any idea where they're corning from?" Since most systems
folks read these bulletin boards, the hacker would find out right
away.</p>

<p>But I could scan for information. I started a text search, hunting
for the word, "Hack." Any messages with that keyword would pop
out.</p>

<p>Oops. Bad choice of keyword. The word hacker is ambiguous. Computer
people use it as a complement to a creative programmer; the public
uses it to describe a skunk that breaks into computers. My search
turned up lots of the former usage and not many of the latter.</p>

<p>A few useful notes turned up, though. A guy in Toronto reported
that his computer had been attacked by a group from Germany. They
called themselves the Chaos Computer Club and seemed to be
technocratic vandals. Another note talked about hackers in Finland
trying to extort money from a corporation by holding their computers
hostage. A third mentioned that a hacker in London ran a credit card
scam, where he sold credit card information over the telephone
lines.</p>

<p>None of these seemed to describe what my hacker was doing. Nor was
it much comfort to realize that others face similar varmints.</p>

<p>I walked out on the roof of the building and looked out over the
bay. Below me, Berkeley and Oakland. Across the water, San Francisco
and the Golden Gate Bridge. For all I<a id="p152" name="p152"></a>
knew, someone within a few blocks was playing an elaborate practical
joke on me. I was fiddling with my secret decoder ring when my beeper
went off. Three dots. Sventek again, and on my Unix machine.</p>

<p>I ran down the staircase and into the switchyard. The hacker was
just logging in. Quickly I called Ron Vivier at Tymnet. No answer. Of
course, dummy, it's a Saturday. Another call to his home. A woman
answered.</p>

<p>"I need to talk to Ron right away. He's got to make a panic network
trace right now." I was out of breath and panting. Five flights of
stairs.</p>

<p>She was taken aback. "He's in the yard washing the van. I'll get
him." A few centuries later, Ron showed up. There were a couple kids
screaming in the background.</p>

<p>"I've got a live one for you," I gasped. "Just trace my port
14."</p>

<p>"Right. It'll take a minute. Good thing I've got two phone lines
here." I hadn't realized that he didn't have a whole switchboard at
his fingertips. He must be dialing into his computer.</p>

<p>Another couple eons passed, and Ron came back on the line. "Hey
Cliff, are you certain that it's the same guy?"</p>

<p>I watched him searching for the word SDI on our computer. "Yes,
it's him." I was still wheezing.</p>

<p>"He's coming in from a gateway that I've never heard of. I'm locked
onto his network address, so it doesn't matter if he hangs up. But the
guy's coming from somewhere strange."</p>

<p>"Where's that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It's Tymnet node 3513, which is a strange one. I'll
have to look it up in our directory." In the background, Ron's
keyboard clicked. "Here it is. That node connects to ITT node DNIC
3106. He's coming from the ITT IRC."</p>

<p>"Huh? What's that mean to me?" His ante was beyond my purse.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," Ron said. "I keep thinking that I'm talking to
another Tymnet guy. Your hacker is coming from outside the Tymnet
system. He's entering Tymnet from a communications line operated by
the International Telephone and Telegraph company."</p>

<p>"So what?"<a id="p153" name="p153"></a></p>

<p>"Tymnet moves data between countries using International Record
Carriers, or IRC's. Once, international agreements forced us to use
IRCs; now we choose the cheapest carrier around. The IRCs are the
go-betweens that link countries together."</p>

<p>"Are you saying that the hacker is coming from abroad?"</p>

<p>"No doubt. ITT takes a Westar downlink. . . ." Ron spoke quickly
and used plenty of acronyms.</p>

<p>"Huh? What's that mean?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"You know," Ron said, "Westar 3." I didn't know, but I was learning
by listening.</p>

<p>He continued, "The communications satellite over the Atlantic. It
handles ten or twenty thousand phone calls at once."</p>

<p>"So my hacker is coming from Europe?"</p>

<p>"For sure."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"That's the part I don't know, and I probably can't find out. But
hold on, and I'll see what's there." More keyboard clicks.</p>

<p>Ron came back to the phone. "Well, ITT identifies the line as DSEA
744031. That's their line number. It can connect to either Spain,
France, Germany, or Britain."</p>

<p>"Well, which is it?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, I don't know. You'll have to call ITT. In three days,
they'll send us billing information, and then I can find
out. Meantime, I can't tell you much more than that."</p>

<p>From twenty-three thousand miles over Brazil, the Westar-3
satellite watches Europe and America at the same time. It relays
microwave signals between the continents, each signal in its own
channel. ITT, the multinational giant, leases a few thousand of
Westar's channels.</p>

<p>Ron went back to washing his car and I crossed the room to the
monitoring printer. Twenty minutes had passed, and my hacker hadn't
wasted a moment. Everything he typed was saved on my printer and
displayed on my computer's screen. If he started to wreck our system,
I could pull his plug by just reaching behind the table.</p>

<p>But he wasn't interested in my lab's computer. He first made sure
that nobody was watching him by seeing who<a id="p154"
name="p154"></a> was logged on, and listing their jobs. Good thing my
monitors were concealed.</p>

<p>Then, he went directly to our network links and logged into the
Network Information Center. This time, he searched for keywords like
CIA, ICBM, ICBMCOM, NORAD, and WSMR. After picking up a few computer
names, he methodically tried to log into each of them, using default
account names like Guest and Visitor. He didn't get far. Five systems
bumped him off with bad passwords.</p>

<p>Like a month ago, when he spent a while trying to get into the
Army's White Sands Missile Range. Over and over, he tried to log onto
their computers. He had no problem finding the names of people working
there&#8212;he just scanned the network directory. But he couldn't
guess their passwords.</p>

<p>The Milnet connects to thousands of computers. Yet he wanted to get
into White Sands. Why bother?</p>

<p>Why's this guy only interested in military stuff? There's a whole
world of computers, yet he's targeting Army bases. Something serious
is going on&#8212;it would be a long time before I found out what.</p>

<p>After half an hour, he gave up on White Sands and tried to get back
into our Elxsi computer. On Halloween, he'd sneaked in there and added
a new account.</p>

<p>Along with the physicist that managed the Elxsi, I'd planted a trap
there. The computer looked like it was still wide open, but when the
hacker touched it, it slowed down. The more the hacker tried to use
it, the slower it went.</p>

<p>Our electronic tar baby worked like an ace. The hacker tried to log
into the Elxsi, and the machine coasted slower and slower. Not quite
halting; he could see that he was making progress, but at an appalling
rate. Elxsi, Inc. would have been ashamed&#8212;theirs is the zippiest
of all minicomputers.</p>

<p>Took him ten minutes to throw in the towel. But he came right back
to our Unix machines, and right out onto the Milnet. This time, he
spent an hour trying to break into forty-two military computers,
literally around the world.</p>

<p>With a single command, <em>telnet,</em> he'd connect to a military
system, and spend one minute trying default account names and
passwords. If he couldn't guess his way in with four tries, he'd go on
to the next computer.<a id="p155" name="p155"></a></p>

<p>He knew how to guess. When greeted by the Unix
response <em>login:,</em> he'd try default accounts like <em>guest,
root, who,</em> and <em>visitor.</em> The Vax-VMS operating system
greets you with <em>Username:;</em> on those systems he tried the
defaults <em>system, field, service,</em> and <em>user.</em> He'd done
this before, and I'm sure that hackers will do it again.</p>

<p>If the Milnet was a roadway, connecting thousands of computers
together, then he was a burglar, patiently visiting each house. He'd
twist the front doorknob to see if it was unlocked, then walk around
and try the back door. Maybe try lifting a window or two.</p>

<p>Most of the time, he found the doors and windows locked. After a
minute pushing them, he'd move on to the next place. Nothing
sophisticated: he wasn't picking locks or digging under
foundations. Just taking advantage of people who left their doors
open.</p>

<p>One after another, he tried military computers: Army Ballistics
Research Lab; U.S. Naval Academy; Naval Research Lab; Air Force
Information Services Group; and places with bizarre acronyms, like
WWMCCS and Cincusnaveur. (Cincus? Or was it Circus? I never found
out.)</p>

<p>Today wasn't lucky for him. None of his guesses panned
out. Forty-two at-bats, forty-two outs.</p>

<p>Clearly, he was going to be on a long time. I reached into my
pocket for a Milky Way candy bar&#8212;what else, for an
astronomer?&#8212;and sat back to watch the hacker on my green
monitor. I could imagine the far end of that long connection. The
hacker sitting behind his monitor, watching the same green characters
on his screen. Probably chewing on his own Milky Way bar. Or smoking a
Benson and Hedges.</p>

<p>It was Saturday, but I figured I'd try to call the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations. They'd told me to call if anything bubbled
up, and the cauldron was boiling now. But no answer. Anyway, there
wasn't much they could do. I needed to know who was at the other end
of ITT's satellite channel.</p>

<p>Only two people knew where I was&#8212;Ron Vivier and Martha. Ron
was washing his car. So when the phone rang in the switchyard, I
answered, "Hello, sweetie!"<a id="p156" name="p156"></a></p>

<p>Silence, then, "Aah, I've probably got the wrong number. I'm
looking for Cliff Stoll." A man's voice with a profound English
accent. Had some British spies found me? Or was the hacker in London?
What a mindgame.</p>

<p>Turned out to be nothing so subtle. Ron Vivier had called Tymnet's
international department, where their experts in transatlantic
communications took over. One of Tymnet's international specialists,
Steve White, started tracing.</p>

<p>Steve works in Vienna, Virginia, making certain that Tymnet's
customers can communicate worldwide. He grew up in Dorset, England,
and first learned to program a computer by mail: he'd write a program
at school, send it to a computer center, and receive the printout a
week later. Steve claims that this makes you write good programs the
first time, since each mistake wastes a week of your time.</p>

<p>Steve had studied zoology at the University of London, and found it
just like astronomy: fascinating but impoverishing. So he moved to the
states, and began working in his other specialty: digital
communications. Steve troubleshoots international communications
systems.</p>

<p>There's a dozen ways to tie computers together&#8212;telephones,
optical fibers, satellite links, and microwave links. At my
laboratory, I didn't care how my data moved, so long as a scientist in
Podunk could reach my computer in Berkeley. It was Steve's job to make
sure that data funnelled in one end of Tymnet reached me at the far
end.</p>

<p>Every communications company has someone like Steve White, or at
least the successful ones do. To him, the network is a gossamer web of
connections: invisible threads that appear and disappear every few
seconds. Each of his three thousand nodes have to be able to instantly
talk to each other.</p>

<p>You could build a network by stringing a wire to every computer,
and then connecting them together in one big switch. With a thousand
terminals at our lab, that's exactly how we did things; a zillion
wires in the switchyard. Local phone companies still work that way:
they route all the neighborhood telephone wires to a single building,
where mechanical switches make connections.</p>

<p>With thousands of computers spread around the country, Tymnet
couldn't have a central exchange. Mechanical<a id="p157"
name="p157"></a> switches were out of the question: too slow and
unreliable. Instead, Tymnet creates virtual circuits between
computers. Across the country, Tymnet's switching computers, called
nodes, communicate with each other over leased cables.</p>

<p>When your computer sends a message to mine, Tymnet treats it like a
piece of mail: it squeezes your data into an envelope and sends it to
one of Tymnet's nodes. There, Tymnet's computers stamp the envelope
with the forwarding address, along with your own calling address. Like
a post office running at the speed of light, special software grabs
each envelope and tosses it to a node nearer its destination. When the
envelope finally reaches my computer, Tymnet removes the address,
opens the envelope, and delivers the data.</p>

<p>There's not one giant switch hooking your computer to
mine. Instead, each network node knows where to toss every data
packet&#8212;a central computer tells it the shortest
path.<a href="#fn158" id="ret158" name="ret158">[*]</a> In crossing
the country, a dozen Tymnet nodes may forward an envelope.</p>

<p>When your computer's silent, the network sits back and handles
other envelopes, but each Tymnet node still remembers where to send
your packets. Every node has a thousand pigeonholes, and is constantly
sorting envelopes.<a id="p158" name="p158"></a></p>

<p>There's no wire to trace; rather, there's a thread of addresses
between your computer and mine. Ron and Steve, the Tymnet guys, could
trace the hacker's connections by untangling this thread. The tail of
the thread originated at an ITT earth station. Beyond there, who could
tell?</p>

<h3>30</h3>

<p class="first">So after months of tracking, the hacker's coming from
Europe. He was still on my computer, trying to chisel into the Navy
Research Labs, when Steve White called.</p>

<p>"Tymnet's connection begins at ITT," Steve said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ron Vivier already told me that. But he says that it could be
from any of four countries."</p>

<p>"Ron can't trace any farther," Steve said, typing on his
terminal. "I'll do the trace <em>myself."</em></p>

<p>"You can trace ITT's lines?"</p>

<p>"Sure. The international record carriers give Tymnet permission to
trace their links, in case of problems. I'll just log into ITT's
switch and see who's calling." Steve made it sound simple.</p>

<p>I kept watching the hacker on my screen, hoping that he wouldn't
hang up while Steve made the trace.</p>

<p>Steve came back on the line. In his modulated, almost theatric
British accent, he said, "Your hacker has the calling address DNIC
dash 2624 dash 542104214."</p>

<p>I'd grown accustomed to not understanding the jargon, but on
principle, I dutifully wrote it down in my logbook. Fortunately, Steve
translated for me.</p>

<p>"You see, as far as Tymnet's concerned, the hacker's coming from
ITT's satellite. But from inside of ITT's computers, I can see past
their satellite link and trace the connection all the way back."</p>

<p>Steve had X-ray vision. Satellites didn't stop him.</p>

<p>"That DNIC number is the data network identifier code. It's just
like a telephone number&#8212;the area code tells where the call
originates."</p>

<p>"So where's the hacker coming from?"<a id="p159"
name="p159"></a></p>

<p>"Germany."</p>

<p>"East or West?"</p>

<p>"West Germany. The German Datex network."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Steve lived in a universe of networks.</p>

<p>"Datex is the German equivalent of Tymnet. It's their national
network to connect computers together," Steve explained. "We'll have
to call the Bundespost to find out more."</p>

<p>I forgot about the hacker on my computer, and listened to
Steve. "You see, the DNIC completely identifies the computer that's
making the call. The first four digits tell me that it's from the
German Datex network. The Bundespost can look up that number in their
catalog, and tell us exactly where it's located."</p>

<p>"Who's the Bundespost?" It sounded vaguely German.</p>

<p>"They're the German national postal service. The government
communications monopoly."</p>

<p>"Why's the post office running networks?" I wondered out
loud. Here, the post office delivers letters, not data.</p>

<p>"In a lot of countries, the post office owns the phone service. An
historical outgrowth of government regulation. Germany's probably the
most centralized of all. You can't get a telephone answering machine
without government approval."</p>

<p>"So the hacker is coming from a government computer?"</p>

<p>"No, it's a private computer, probably. But the communications link
is operated by the Bundespost. And that's our next step. We'll ring up
the Bundespost in the morning."</p>

<p>I liked how he said "we" rather than "you."</p>

<p>Steve and I talked for a solid hour. Listening to his descriptions
of the network was far more interesting than watching the hacker scan
my computer for keywords like SDI. Steve wasn't a technician, but a
craftsperson; no, an artist who expressed himself through an invisible
tapestry of electronic threads.</p>

<p>To hear Steve speak of it, the network is a living, growing
organism. It senses trouble and responds to its environment. To him,
the network's elegance lay in its simplicity. "Each node just passes
the data on to the next."</p>

<p>"Every time your visitor types a key," Steve said, "a character
bounces from Datex to ITT to Tymnet and into<a id="p160"
name="p160"></a> your system. And between keystrokes, our network
wastes no time on him."</p>

<p>With thousands of conversations threaded through his system and
millions of bits of data, not one dialogue was lost, and not a byte of
data spilled out. The network kept track of the connections, and you
couldn't slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>All the same, Steve seemed pessimistic about completing a
successful trace. "We know where he connects into the system. But
there's a couple possibilities there. The hacker might be at a
computer in Germany, simply connected over the German Datex
network. If that's the case, then we've got him cold. We know his
address, the address points to his computer, and the computer points
to him."</p>

<p>"Seems unlikely," I said, thinking of my trace to Mitre.</p>

<p>"It is unlikely. More likely, the hacker is coming into the German
Datex network through a dial-in modem."</p>

<p>Just like Tymnet, Datex lets anyone dial into their system, and
connect to computers on the network. Perfect for business people and
scientists. And hackers.</p>

<p>"The real problem is in German law," Steve said. "I don't think
they recognize hacking as a crime."</p>

<p>"You're kidding, of course."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "a lot of countries have outdated laws. In Canada, a
hacker that broke into a computer was convicted of stealing
electricity, rather than trespassing. He was prosecuted only because
the connection had used a microwatt of power from the computer."</p>

<p>"But breaking into a computer is a crime in the USA."</p>

<p>"Yes, but do you think the hacker will be extradited for that?"
Steve asked. "Look at the support you got from the FBI. Be serious,
Cliff."</p>

<p>Steve's pessimism was contagious. But his trace jagged my spirits:
so what if we couldn't nail the hacker&#8212;our circle was closing
around him.</p>

<p>This hacker, though, knew nothing of our trace. He finally
disconnected at 5:22, after two hours of twisting doorknobs and
scanning files. My printer captured everything, but the real news was
Steve White's work.</p>

<p>Germany. I ran over to the library and dug out an atlas. Germany's
nine hours ahead of us. The hacker showed up<a id="p161"
name="p161"></a> around noon or 1 P.M.; for him, it's 9 or 1O
P.M. He's probably taking advantage of cheap rates.</p>

<p>Poring over the atlas, I remembered Maggie Morley recognizing the
hacker's password. "Jaeger&#8212;it's a German word meaning Hunter."
The answer had been right in front of me, but I'd been blind.</p>

<p>This explained the timing of the acknowledgement echos when the
hacker used the Kermit file transfers. I'd measured 6000 miles to the
hacker, though I'd never relied much on that figure. I should
have. Germany was 5200 miles from Berkeley.</p>

<p>Not just blind. Deaf as well.</p>

<p>I'd been gathering facts. Not interpreting them.</p>

<p>Sitting alone in the library, I was suddenly deeply embarrassed
over sending my sister on a wild-goose chase, searching for a high
school kid in Virginia; and the Berkeley detectives, running around
campus with revolvers.</p>

<p>I'd messed up. For months, I'd scoured North America, searching for
the hacker. Dave Cleveland kept telling me, "The hacker's not from the
West Coast." No, not by 5200 miles.</p>

<p>Some details were still fuzzy, but I understood how he
operated. Somewhere in Europe, the hacker called into the German Datex
network. He asked for Tymnet, and the Bundespost made the connection
through the international record carrier. Once he reached the States,
he connected to my laboratory and hacked his way around the
Milnet.</p>

<p>Mitre must have been his stopover point. I could see how he made
the connection. He'd entered the German Datex system, asked for
Tymnet, and then logged into Mitre. Once there, he could explore their
computers at his leisure. When he grew tired of reading the defense
contractor's reports, he could dial out from Mitre, connecting
anywhere in North America&#8212;with Mitre picking up the tab.</p>

<p>But who paid for his transatlantic connections? According to Steve,
his sessions cost fifty or one hundred dollars an hour. Walking back
to the computer room, I realized that I was following a well-heeled
hacker. Or a clever thief.</p>

<p>Now I realized why Mitre paid for a thousand one-minute-long phone
calls. The hacker would connect to Mitre, and instruct their system to
phone another computer. When it<a id="p162" name="p162"></a> answered,
he would try to log in with a default name and password. Usually he
failed, and went on to another phone number. He'd been scanning
computers, with Mitre picking up the tab.</p>

<p>But he'd left a trail. On Mitre's phone bills.</p>

<p>The path led back to Germany, but it might not end
there. Conceivably, someone in Berkeley had called Berlin, connected
to the Datex network, connected through Tymnet and came back to
Berkeley. Maybe the start of the path was in Mongolia. Or Moscow. I
couldn't tell. For the present, my working hypothesis would be
Germany.</p>

<p>And he scanned for <em>military</em> secrets. Could I be following
a spy? A real spy, working for <em>them&#8212;</em>but who's them?
. . . Jeez&#8212;I didn't even know who spies work for.</p>

<p>Three months ago, I'd seen some mouse droppings in my accounting
files. Quietly, we watched this mouse, seeing him sneak through our
computer, and out through a hole and into the military networks and
computers.</p>

<p>At last I knew what this rodent was after. And where he was
from. I'd been mistaken.</p>

<p>This wasn't a mouse. It was a rat.</p>

<h3>31</h3>

<p class="first">I spent Saturday evening filling in my logbook. Now I
could tie up loose ends. Anniston's search wouldn't turn up a hacker
in Alabama: they were off by five thousand miles. Stanford's hacker
was certainly a different guy ... my hacker would have homework in
German, not English. And there wasn't much use in calling around
Berkeley, looking for someone named Hedges.</p>

<p>Probably the wrong name. Certainly the wrong continent.</p>

<p>Our stack of printouts was a foot thick. I'd carefully sorted and
dated each listing, but I'd never combed through all the listings at
one sitting. Most of it was dreary file listings and one-at-a-time
guesses at passwords.</p>

<p>Is it easy to break into computers?<a id="p163"
name="p163"></a></p>

<p>Elementary, my dear Watson. Elementary, and tediously dull.</p>

<p>I didn't return home until 2 a.m. Martha waited up, piecing a
quilt.</p>

<p>"Out with a hussy?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," I replied. "Spent the day with a mysterious foreigner."</p>

<p>"So the hacker's from Europe after all." She'd guessed what I'd
been doing.</p>

<p>"He might live anywhere in the world," I said, "but my bets are on
Germany."</p>

<p>I wanted to sleep late Sunday morning, curled up with Martha. But,
dammit, my pager sounded at 10:44, a harsh, insistent squeal followed
by a Morse code greeting. The hacker was at it again. In my Unix-5
computer.</p>

<p>I jumped into the dining room and dialed Steve White at his
home. While his phone was ringing, I fired up my Macintosh
computer. On the fifth ring, Steve answered.</p>

<p>"The hacker is live again, Steve," I told him.</p>

<p>"OK, Cliff. I'll start the trace and call you back."</p>

<p>As soon as I hung up, I reached for my Macintosh. The beast acted
like a remote terminal, thanks to a modem and a stellar software
program called Red Ryder. Red auto-magically dialed my lab's computer,
logged onto the Vax, and showed me what was up. There was my hacker,
traipsing through the Milnet.</p>

<p>Logged on like that, I appeared like an ordinary user, so the
hacker could see me if he looked. So I disconnected quickly. Ten
seconds was enough to see what my visitor was up to.</p>

<p>Steve called back in a couple minutes. The line didn't come from
the ITT international record carrier; today it was from RCA.</p>

<p>"RCA doesn't use the Westar satellite," Steve said. "They talk
through the Comsat satellite." Yesterday he used Westar, today
Comsat. One elusive hacker&#8212;switching communications satellites
from day to day.</p>

<p>But I had my facts wrong, and Steve set me straight.</p>

<p>"Your hacker doesn't have any choice in the matter," Steve
explained. "To provide redundant service, we use a variety of
international routes."<a id="p164" name="p164"></a></p>

<p>With every call, Tymnet's traffic takes a different route across
the Atlantic. As a customer I would never notice, but traffic is
spread across four or five satellites and cables.</p>

<p>"Oh, like interstate trucking, before deregulation."</p>

<p>"Don't get me started," Steve said angrily. "You wouldn't believe
the international communications laws."</p>

<p>"So where's the hacker coming from today?"</p>

<p>"Germany. Same address. Same place."</p>

<p>There wasn't much more to do. I couldn't monitor the hacker from
home, and Steve had finished the trace. I sat shivering next to the
Macintosh. Where do I go next?</p>

<p>To the lab. And quick. I scribbled a note for Martha ("The game is
afoot"), threw on some jeans, and hopped on my bike.</p>

<p>I wasn't fast enough. The hacker disappeared five minutes before I
arrived. I should have stayed in bed.</p>

<p>Well, I paged through Sunday morning's listing&#8212;Sunday evening
for him&#8212;and saw him up to his old tricks. One by one, trying to
break into military computers by guessing obvious
passwords. Tedious. About as interesting as guessing locker
combinations.</p>

<p>Since he'd shown up in the morning, I might as well wait around and
see if he'd return. Based on my statistics, he'd be back within an
hour or two.</p>

<p>Sure enough, he returned at 1:16 in the afternoon. My pager sounded
off, and I ran to the switchyard. There he was, logging into the
stolen Sventek account.</p>

<p>As usual, he looked around for others on the computer. Had I been
connected from my home, he'd have noticed me. But from my high ground
in the switchyard, I was undetectable. He couldn't pierce my
electronic veil.</p>

<p>Confident that nobody was watching him, he headed straight out
through our Milnet port. With a few commands, he searched the Milnet
directory for any locations with the acronym "COC." Huh? I'd never
seen such a word. Did he misspell something?</p>

<p>I needn't have wondered. The network information computer cranked
for a minute or two, and then returned a half dozen military Command
Operations Centers. He kept searching for other key words: "Cheyenne,"
"icbm," "combat," "kh11," "Pentagon," and "Colorado."<a id="p165"
name="p165"></a></p>

<p>Sitting there watching him paw through the Milnet directory, I felt
like I was watching someone thumbing through the yellow pages. Which
numbers would he dial?</p>

<p>All of them. Every keyword brought up a few computer addresses, and
after he'd found thirty of them, he closed his connection to the
Milnet directory. Then, once again, he methodically tried to break
into each of the sites; the Air Force Data Services Center in
Arlington, Virginia, the Army Ballistics Research Lab, an Air Force
training center in Colorado Springs, the Navy Pacific Monitoring
Center in Hawaii, and thirty other places.</p>

<p>But again, he had no luck. By chance, he'd picked places which
didn't have obvious passwords. It must have been a frustrating evening
for him.</p>

<p>Finally, he tried to break into his old haunt, the Anniston Army
base. Five times. No luck.</p>

<p>So he gave up on the Milnet and returned to messing with my Unix
computer. I watched the cuckoo lay its egg: once again, he manipulated
the files in my computer to make himself super-user. His same old
trick: use the Gnu-Emacs move-mail to substitute his tainted program
for the system's atrun file. Five minutes later, shazam! He was system
manager.</p>

<p>Now I had to watch him carefully. With his illicit privileges, he
could destroy my system, either by accident or on purpose. And it
would only take one command, like <em>rm * &#8212;</em>erase all
files.</p>

<p>For now, though, he restrained himself. He just printed out phone
numbers of different computers, and logged off.</p>

<p>Uh oh. He took a list of telephone numbers that our computer often
connects to.</p>

<p>But Mitre had cut off their outbound telephone service. He must
have discovered this by now. Yet he still collected phone numbers. So
he must have some other way to make phone calls. Mitre wasn't his only
stepping stone to the telephone system.</p>

<p>He came back to my system after fifteen minutes. Wherever he'd
gone, none of his calls had panned out. Bad passwords, I'll bet.</p>

<p>As soon as he returned, he started Kermit running. He was going to
copy a file back to his computer. My password<a id="p166"
name="p166"></a> file again? No, he wanted my network software. He
tried to export the source code to two programs: <em>telnet</em>
and <em>rlogin.</em> Whenever one of my scientists connects through
the Milnet, they use <em>telnet</em> or <em>rlogin.</em> Both of them
let someone remotely log into a foreign computer. Each of them
transfers commands from a user over to a foreign computer. Either is a
perfect place to plant a Trojan horse.</p>

<p>By changing a couple lines of code in our <em>telnet</em> program,
he could make a password grabber. Whenever my scientists connected to
a distant system, his insidious program would stash their passwords
into a secret file. Oh, they'd log in successfully. But the next time
the hacker came into my Berkeley computer, there'd be a list of
passwords waiting to be picked up.</p>

<p>Line by line, I watched Kermit shovel the program over to the
hacker. No need to time the transfer&#8212;I now knew those long
delays were caused by satellite and the long hop into Germany.</p>

<p>Watching him, I got annoyed. No, pissed off. He was stealing my
software. Sensitive software at that. If he wanted it, he'd have to
swipe it from someone else.</p>

<p>But I couldn't just kill Kermit. He'd notice that right away. Now
that I was closing in on him, I especially didn't want to tip my
hand.</p>

<p>I had to act fast. How do I stop a burglar without letting on that
I'm watching?</p>

<p>I found my key chain and reached over to the wires connected to the
hacker's line. Jangling the keys across the connector, I shorted out
his circuit for an instant. This added just enough noise to confuse
the computer, but not enough to kill the connection. To him, it would
look like some characters had become garbled. Misspelled words and
unintelligible text&#8212;the computer equivalent of radio static.</p>

<p>He'd blame it on network interference. He might try again, but
eventually, he'd give up. When the connections are lousy, there's no
use in talking long distance.</p>

<p>It worked like a charm. I'd jangle my keys, he'd see noise, and his
computer would ask for a replay of the last line. I was careful to let
a little data get through. But so slowly that the whole file would
take all night.</p>

<p>The hacker disconnected and tried again. No way. He<a id="p167"
name="p167"></a> couldn't make it through my fog, and he couldn't
figure out where the noise was coming from.</p>

<p>He gave up trying to steal our software, and contented himself with
just looking around. He found a pathway into Berkeley's Opal computer,
but didn't explore it.</p>

<p>Now there's a strange one. The Berkeley Opal computer is the home
of some real computer research. You don't have to look far to find
some of the finest communications programs, academic software, and
games. Apparently this hacker didn't care for the things students
might be interested in. But show him something military, and he goes
wild.</p>

<p>It was 5:51 in the afternoon when the hacker finally called it
quits. I can't say that his every frustration gave me
satisfaction. Rather, he responded the way I expected. My work was
slowly yielding a solution.</p>

<p>Steve White traced the connections throughout the day. Just as in
the morning, they all came from Germany.</p>

<p>"Any chance that it's someone from another European country?" I
asked, knowing the answer in advance.</p>

<p>"The hacker could be from anywhere," Steve answered. "My trace only
proves a connection from Berkeley into Germany."</p>

<p>"Any idea where in Germany?"</p>

<p>Steve was as curious as I. "There's no way to tell without a
directory. Every network has its own way of using the address. The
Bundespost will tell us tomorrow."</p>

<p>"So you'll call them in the morning?" I asked, wondering whether he
spoke German.</p>

<p>"No, it's easier to send electronic mail," Steve said. "I've
already sent a message about yesterday's incident; today's will
confirm it, and add a few more details. Don't worry, they'll hop to
it."</p>

<p>Steve couldn't hang around this Sunday afternoon&#8212;he was
cooking a dinner with his lady friend Lynn&#8212;which reminded me of
Martha. I hadn't called home.</p>

<p>Martha wasn't pleased. She'd left word with Claudia that she'd be
out late. Were it not for this hacker, we'd be hiking in the
redwoods. Oops.<a id="p168" name="p168"></a></p>

<h3>32</h3>

<p class="first">Last night was a tense time at home. Martha didn't
talk much. By spending the day watching the hacker, I'd wrecked a fine
Sunday afternoon. Progress with the hacker had cost dearly on the home
front.</p>

<p>Who should I tell about the latest discovery? My boss, for
sure. We'd had a bet on where the hacker came from, and I'd lost. I
owed him a box of cookies.</p>

<p>The FBI? Well, they hadn't shown much interest, but this was now
out of the league of my local police. Might as well give them another
chance to ignore us.</p>

<p>Air Force Office of Special Investigations? They'd asked to be kept
aware. With the hacker's attacks on military computers, I ought to
tell someone from the defense establishment, no matter how politically
awkward I felt.</p>

<p>If it was hard to talk to the military, then calling the CIA was a
real hurdle. A month ago, I'd accepted that they needed to know about
someone trying to break into their computers. I'd done my duty. Now,
should I tell them that it's a foreigner?</p>

<p>But once again, they seemed like the right people to call. I could
understand the nodes, and networks, but espionage . . . well, they
don't teach you that stuff in grad school.</p>

<p>Surely my friends among Berkeley's flourishing left wing would tell
me I'd be co-opted by the State. But I didn't exactly feel like a tool
of the ruling class, unless imperialist running-dog puppets
breakfasted on stale granola. I argued with myself as I biked through
traffic, but my guts told me what to do: the CIA should know, and I
ought to tell them.</p>

<p>It had been a constant struggle to get the bureaucracy to
move. Maybe I could get someone to notice by waving this flag in front
of all the three-letter agencies.</p>

<p>First I'd call the FBI. Their Oakland office hadn't been
interested, but maybe I could get a rise out of Mike Gibbons in
Alexandria, Virginia. But Mike was on vacation, so I left a message,
figuring he'd hear it in a couple of weeks.<a id="p169"
name="p169"></a> "Just tell him that Cliff called. And that my friend
has a return address in Germany." You can't fit much on a yellow
while-you-were-out note.</p>

<p>My second pitch was to the Air Force OSI&#8212;the air force
narcs. Two people got on the line, a woman's voice and a gravelly
man's voice.</p>

<p>The woman, Ann Funk, was a special agent specializing in family
crimes. In a serious tone, she explained, "Wife beating, child
abuse. The Air Force has the same ugly problems as the rest of the
world." Not hi-tech stuff, but even over the phone, her presence
inspired respect and sympathy. Now, she worked with the OSI's computer
crime group.</p>

<p>A month ago, I'd spoken with Jim Christy. Today, his first question
to me was the same as I'd asked Steve: "East or West Germany?"</p>

<p>"West," I answered. "We'll know more in the next couple days."</p>

<p>"Where'd did he get into?" Ann asked.</p>

<p>"Nowhere, at least that I saw. Not that he didn't try." I rattled
off some of the places he tried to sneak into.</p>

<p>"We'll have to call you back," Jim said. "We have an office in
Europe that might be able to work on this."</p>

<p>I'd given the Air Force a heads-up warning. Let's see what they'd
do.</p>

<p>Time to call the CIA. Teejay's office answered&#8212;he wasn't
in. Whew. Off the hook. I felt like a kid who had to give a report to
the class, only to find that the teacher was sick.</p>

<p>But having made up my mind to tell the spooks, I called Teejay's
fellow spy, Greg Fennel. Greg was in, all right.</p>

<p>"Look, I've got a meeting in three minutes. Keep it short." A busy
day at the CIA.</p>

<p>"In short, we traced the hacker to Germany. Goodbye!"</p>

<p>"Huh? Wait! How'd you do it? Are you sure it's the same guy?"</p>

<p>"You've got a meeting now. We can talk tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Forget the meeting. Just tell me what happened. Don't embellish,
don't interpret."</p>

<p>Easy to do when you keep a logbook. I read off my weekend's
summary. An hour later, Greg was still asking questions, and had
forgotten his meeting. It hit him where he lived.<a id="p170"
name="p170"></a></p>

<p>"Fascinating," the spy thought out loud. "Someone in West Germany
is breaking into our networks. Or at least they're coming through a
West German gateway." He understood that we'd identified one link in
the chain. The hacker still could be anywhere.</p>

<p>"Any chance that you'll take action?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That's for someone else to decide. I'll pass it up the chain of
command, but I really don't know what will happen."</p>

<p>What did I expect? The CIA couldn't do much to solve the
problem&#8212;they were information gatherers. I hoped they'd take
over the whole mess, but that seemed unlikely. The hacker wasn't in
their machines, he was in ours.</p>

<p>Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory was tired of wasting time on the
chase. I hid my hacker work, but everyone could see that I wasn't
tending to our system. Scientific software slowly decayed while I
built programs to analyze what the hacker was doing.</p>

<p>Fearing my vitriolic boss, I polished up on quantum mechanics
before talking to Roy Kerth. Maybe if we talked physics for a while,
he might overlook my work on the hacker front. After all, he seemed
pleased by my graphics software, even though I thought it was
comparatively trivial.</p>

<p>But no amount of shop talk could deflect Roy's anger. He was
irritated about the time I'd spent tracking this hacker. I wasn't
contributing to the department&#8212;nothing that he could show off,
nothing he could quantify.</p>

<p>At least he didn't shut me down. If anything, he seemed more eager
than ever to nail this eggsucker.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours searching bulletin boards on the Usenet network
for news about hackers, and found one note from Canada. I called the
author on the phone&#8212;I didn't trust electronic mail. Bob Orr, a
scientist at the University of Toronto, told a sad story.</p>

<p>"We connect to lots of networks, and it's tough to convince funding
agencies to pay for it. Some hackers from Germany have invaded our
system, changing programs and damaging our operating system."</p>

<p>"How'd they get in?" I asked, already suspecting the answer.</p>

<p>"We collaborate with the Swiss physics lab, CERN. And<a id="p171"
name="p171"></a> those vandals have thoroughly walked through their
computers. They probably stole passwords to our system, and linked
directly to us."</p>

<p>"Did they do any damage?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Damage! Haven't you been listening?" Bob exploded. "Our networks
are delicate things&#8212;people connect to us in hope of mutual
support. When someone breaks into a computer, they destroy that
trust. Aside from wasting days of my time, and forcing us to disable
our network connections, these hackers undermine the openness that
lets us do science together."</p>

<p>"But did they erase your files?" I asked. "Did they change any
programs?"</p>

<p>"Well, they modified my system to give them a backdoor
password. But if you're looking for headlines like, 'Hacker wipes out
entire system,' you won't find them here. These break-ins are far more
insidious. They're technically skilled but ethically bankrupt
programmers without any respect for others' work&#8212;or
privacy. They're not destroying one or two programs. They're trying to
wreck the cooperation that builds our networks."</p>

<p>Whew! Here was a guy who took his computing seriously. I hadn't
learned much about hackers from Germany, but at last I'd spoken to
someone who described them with the same expletives that I used. Bob
realized that damage wasn't measured in dollars ripped off, but rather
in trust lost. He didn't see this as fun and games, but a serious
assault on an open society.</p>

<p>Once, I would have argued with Bob, saying that these were only
kids fooling around. Once, I might have smiled and respected anyone
who could hack around in so many computers. Not anymore.</p>

<p>As an aside, Bob told me the German Chaos Club was attacking the
U.S. Fermilab computer as well. I called Fermilab in Illinois and
talked with their system manager. "Yes, some German hackers have been
giving us headaches. They call themselves the Chaos Computer
Club."</p>

<p>"Were they spying?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Be serious. There's no classified work here."</p>

<p>I wondered. Were they vandals or spies? "Can you identify who's
breaking in?"<a id="p172" name="p172"></a></p>

<p>"One guy uses the pseudonym Hagbard. Another, Pengo. I don't know
their real names."</p>

<p>"Have you secured your system since you detected them?"</p>

<p>"A little. We're trying to do science, so we don't want to shut our
doors to the world. But these vandals are making it tough to run an
open computing center. I wish they'd pick on someone else&#8212;like
the military, for instance. Or NSA."</p>

<p>If only he knew. "I suppose the police haven't been much help?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Not much. They listen, but they're not doing much."</p>

<p>I called Stanford and asked one of their system managers, Dan
Kolkowitz, if he'd heard anything from Germany.</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, someone broke in a few months ago. I
monitored what he did, and have a listing of him. It looks
German."</p>

<p>Dan read the listing over the phone. Some hacker with the nom de
guerre of Hagbard was sending a file of passwords to some hackers
named Zombie and Pengo.</p>

<p>Hagbard and Pengo again. I wrote them in my logbook.</p>

<p>Still, it seemed like these guys were right. Those hackers were
vandals who wanted to create trouble. They attacked universities and
scientific institutes&#8212;easy pickings. They didn't seem interested
in military targets, and didn't seem to know how to navigate the
Milnet.</p>

<p>I realized another difference between my hacker and the Chaos Club
hoodlums. My hacker seemed at home on Unix; not the Berkeley version,
but Unix all the same. The vandals that Bob and Dan described seemed
to only attack Dec's VMS operating systems.</p>

<p>From now on, I'd watch for any news about the Chaos Computer Club,
but I couldn't assume that all German hackers were in league
together.</p>

<p>One good thing was happening. One by one, I was making contact with
other people who were losing sleep and slugging down Maalox over the
same troubles that obsessed me. It was comforting to learn that I
wasn't completely alone.</p>

<p>It was time to take my mind off the hacker and return to
astronomy. No such luck&#8212;Mike Gibbons of the FBI called.</p>

<p>"I thought you were on vacation," I said.</p>

<p>"I am. At my folks' place, in Denver."<a id="p173"
name="p173"></a></p>

<p>"Then how'd you get my message?" I wondered if the CIA had
called.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy," Mike said. "We're on two-hour alert. Day or
night, the office can reach me. Sometimes makes my marriage
uncomfortable."</p>

<p>I understood all too well. My own beeper was an albatross. "Did you
hear about the German connection?"</p>

<p>"How about telling me what happened over the weekend." (Just the
facts, ma'am.)</p>

<p>Once again, I read from my logbook. I'd reached the part about the
DNIC numbers, when Mike interrupted.</p>

<p>"Can you Fed-ex your logbook here?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I'll print out a copy and ship it to you." Easy to do when
you keep your notes inside a computer.</p>

<p>"I'll see if we can open a case. No promises, but this looks
interesting." By now I'd learned that nobody ever promised to do
anything.</p>

<p>I printed out a copy of my logbook and dropped it off at the
express office.</p>

<p>When I returned, the phone was ringing. It was Teejay.</p>

<p>"I heard the news," said my CIA contact. "You're sure your friend
lives across the puddle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you mean the Atlantic." Teejay's shorthand might confuse
an eavesdropper, but they threw me for a loop every time. "Almost
certainly he's from Germany, and I'd be amazed if he's from the
States."</p>

<p>"Do you know his exact location?"</p>

<p>"All I know is the electronic address of a computer. It's a DNIC
number, whatever that means."</p>

<p>"Who's going to decode it for you?"</p>

<p>"I expect the Bundespost to tell us who's at the other end. Maybe
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Have you called the, uh, northern entity?"</p>

<p>Northern entity? Who's that? "You mean the 'F' entity?"</p>

<p>"No, the entity in the north. You know, Mr. Meade's place."</p>

<p>Meade. Fort Meade. He must mean the National Security Agency. "No,
I called the 'F' entity, though."</p>

<p>"Good. Are they moving or sitting on their butts?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. They might open an investigation, but they wouldn't
promise."<a id="p174" name="p174"></a></p>

<p>"They never do. I'll get in touch with them and see if we can help
things along. Meanwhile, why don't you call the northern entity, and
see if they'll decode that address."</p>

<p>Of course. NSA must have lists of every telephone number and
electronic address in the world. I dialed the National Computer
Security Center.</p>

<p>Zeke Hanson answered my call.</p>

<p>"Hey, Zeke, remember that you said that NSA can't help me if the
hacker's coming from America?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, so what?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's from Europe."</p>

<p>"You mean that you've been following a foreigner on the
Milnet?"</p>

<p>"You heard right."</p>

<p>"Let me call you right back."</p>

<p>By now, I'd gotten used to these call backs. The spooks either have
secure telephone lines, or assume that I'm calling from a phone
booth.</p>

<p>For the fifth time, I gave a how-I-spent-my-weekend talk. Zeke
listened intently, obviously taking notes.</p>

<p>"Think the hacker's on assignment?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. But I suspect he's saving his printouts."</p>

<p>"How about sending me a list of keywords that he's searched
for."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd be happy to, but I'm kinda busy today. Mostly, I'm
trying to find the electronic address that belongs to that German DNIC
number. I'd be glad to swap information."</p>

<p>"You mean you'll send me copies of the traffic in return for
looking up that address?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Seems like a fair trade to me." If I simply asked for the
address point blank, he'd turn me down.</p>

<p>It didn't work. Zeke stood his ground. "No possible way. I can't
even confirm that we have such information."</p>

<p>Stymied. I'd have to decode that address some other way.</p>

<p>Frustrating, too. All day long, secret agencies were asking details
from me, but nobody ever told <em>me</em> anything.</p>

<p>The day's flurry left me exhausted, but hopeful. This one trace to
Germany opened several doors. The spooks could no longer wash this
away as a minor domestic disturbance. It still might be minor, but it
certainly wasn't domestic.</p>

<p>175</p>

<h3>33</h3>

<p class="first">I'd kicked over an anthill. For the next few days, I
couldn't get away from my phone. The spooks kept calling back, asking
for technical details&#8212;how do you connect from Europe into
military computers? Could I prove that the hacker came from Germany?
Where did he pick up passwords? How did he become super-user?</p>

<p>The Air Force OSI, however, worried about how to defend the
Milnet. Did the hacker get into this site or that network? What type
of computers did he attack? Could we contain him by locking him out of
Lawrence Berkeley Labs?</p>

<p>Finally, Steve White called. He'd received a terse message from the
manager of the German Datex network:</p>

<p>"The address belongs to a computer in Bremen. We investigate."</p>

<p>Our circle was slowly closing.</p>

<p>I was off to the library again, paging through the atlas. Bremen's
a port city in northern Germany, renowned for its medieval paintings
and town hall. Momentarily, my thoughts flew across the Atlantic
. . . these are places from history books.</p>

<p>On the heels of Steve's call, Mike Muuss of the Ballistic Research
Laboratory called. In Aberdeen, Maryland, the Army runs a research and
development laboratory; it's one of the last government labs that
doesn't farm out its research to private contractors. Mike's their
computer honcho.</p>

<p>Mike Muuss&#8212;he's famous throughout the Unix community as a
pioneer in networking and as a creator of elegant programs to replace
awkward ones. As Mike puts it, good programs aren't written or
built. They're grown. A six-foot-tall, mustached runner, he's
incredibly driven, intense, and obsessed. Mike's paid his dues on
ancient versions of Unix, dating back to the '70s. When Mike talks,
other wizards listen.</p>

<p>"We detected Joe Sventek probing our system on Sunday," Mike Muuss
said. "I thought he was in England."<a id="p176" name="p176"></a></p>

<p>Do all wizards know each other? Is it telepathy?</p>

<p>"He is," I replied. "You detected a hacker masquerading as
Joe."</p>

<p>"Well, keep him off the network. Boot him out."</p>

<p>I'd been through that before. "Closing him from my computer
probably won't stop him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's in a lot of computers, huh?" Mike understood.</p>

<p>We chatted about an hour, and I tried to hide my ignorance. Mike
assumed that I knew about the Eniac, the world's first big
computer. "Yep, it was right here at Ballistics Research Lab. Back in
1948. Ten years before I was born."</p>

<p>Eniac might have been their first world class computer, but hardly
their last. Now, the Army runs a pair of Cray supercomputers&#8212;the
fastest in the world. Without much modesty, Mike said, "If you want to
see the Army in the year 2010, look in my computers today. It's all
there."</p>

<p>Exactly what the hacker wanted.</p>

<p>Soon after that call, Chris McDonald of White Sands phoned. He'd
also heard someone pounding at his doors and wanted to know what we
intended to do about it.</p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied. "Nothing until the bastard's been arrested."
A bluff, considering the chances of even discovering where the hacker
lived.</p>

<p>The hacker had tried to chisel into eighty computers. Two system
managers had detected him.</p>

<p>Suppose you walked along a city street trying to force doors
open. How long would it take before someone called the cops? Five
houses? Ten?</p>

<p>Well, with the help of the hacker, I knew the answer. On the
computer networks, you can bang on forty doors before someone
notices. With this kind of guard our computers are sitting
ducks. Almost nobody's watching for intruders trying to break in.</p>

<p>My own lab was as blind as anyone else. The hacker had broken in,
become system manager, and had full run of my Unix computer before we
detected him. Even then, we'd stumbled on him by accident.</p>

<p>It seemed unlikely that computer people could detect hackers in
their systems. Well, maybe they could, but nobody was looking. So it
was fruitful to keep combing through<a id="p177" name="p177"></a>
Mitre's phone bills. The hacker had clearly called TRW, Incorporated
in Redondo Beach; he'd spent hours hooked into their computer.</p>

<p>TRW&#8212;they're a defense contractor, working for the Air Force
and NASA.</p>

<p>When I called Howard Siegal of TRW's signal processing facility,
he'd never heard a thing.</p>

<p>"We can't possibly have a hacker here. We're running a secure
facility."</p>

<p>By definition, they were secure. I'd heard it before. "Just for my
curiosity, could you check your accounting logs for the past couple
months?"</p>

<p>He agreed, though I didn't expect to hear back from him. The next
morning, though, he called back with bad news.</p>

<p>"You were right," Howard said. "Someone's been in our system, but I
can't discuss it. We're closing all access to our computer." He
wouldn't describe what evidence had changed his mind, nor would he say
if the hacker had become super-user.</p>

<p>I mentioned TRW to my friends at the Keck Observatory. Terry Mast
raised his eyebrows: "Hell, they're the defense contractors that built
the KH-11."</p>

<p>Wait a second. I'd seen KH-11 before. The hacker scanned for that
keyword on Saturday. "Say, Terry, what's the KH-11?"</p>

<p>"It's a spy satellite. A secret spy satellite. KH stands for Key
Hole. It's the eleventh in a series. It's obsolete now."</p>

<p>"Replaced by the KH-12, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, in fact. Massive cost overruns, the usual. Both of them are
extremely secret projects." Secrecy automatically multiplied the cost
of any project.</p>

<p>After a while, Steve White of Tymnet called back. The German
Bundespost had determined that the hacker came from the University of
Bremen. The address pointed to a Vax computer, not a telephone line,
but the University knew nothing of any hacker. Apparently, they
doubted that a hacker was on their computer. I wasn't surprised: I'd
heard it before. Give 'em a day or two, I thought.</p>

<p>A Vax computer, at a university. A university pointed to a
student. I wondered if my gut feeling was wrong: could I just be
chasing some poor sophomore prankster?<a id="p178"
name="p178"></a></p>

<p>When talking to the CIA and NSA, I'd been careful to point out that
possibility. It was bad enough to waste my time on this quest. I
didn't want the spooks to gird up for battle, only to find some kid
with a peashooter.</p>

<p>But the spooks asked me speculative questions. Zeke at the NSA:
"Can you characterize this person's computer experience?" Well, that's
easy. Just list what he's done, and how adept he appears. Then, "How
old is he?" and "Is he paid or is this his hobby?" I could only guess
at these: the hacker never typed in his age, weight, and
occupation.</p>

<p>All my callers wanted to know about the hacker, even if they hadn't
the slightest interest in solving the case. My logbook held the
information, but was well over fifty pages. To get out from under
these phone calls, I wrote a note describing what I knew about him. By
bringing together observations about him, perhaps I could paint a
profile of this hacker.</p>

<p>Some of their questions I could answer directly: he targeted the
military and defense contractors. He guessed and stole passwords. He'd
usually work at nights, German time.</p>

<p>Other answers came from indirect observations: he seemed to be in
his twenties&#8212;his experience in Unix and VMS told me
that. Probably out of college&#8212;he worked even when school was
out. And only a smoker would choose Benson and Hedges as
passwords.</p>

<p>I must be watching only one or two people. I inferred this by
knowing that he had four purloined accounts on my system, yet he had
chosen the same password for all of them. Had there more than a couple
people in on the caper, they would have chosen separate passwords.</p>

<p>In writing this profile, I got an impression of someone methodical
and diligent. He'd been active for well over six months&#8212;and some
of Mitre's records indicated almost a year. He didn't mind spending
two hours on Sunday night, slowly trying to guess passwords into
military computers. Tedious and tiresome work.</p>

<p>The NSA kept pushing at my conclusions. Zeke asked, "If he's so
methodical, how do you know you're not just following some computer
program?"<a id="p179" name="p179"></a></p>

<p>This one threw me for a loop. Zeke had challenged me on a point I
hadn't thought of before.</p>

<p>Could I prove that I was following a real person?</p>

<p>I'd once assumed that computer hackers were brilliant geniuses,
creatively searching out ways to build new programs. This guy was
patient and plodding, repeatedly trying the same tricks. The same sort
of behavior you'd expect to find from a computer program.</p>

<p>Suppose someone had programmed a computer to methodically try to
log into a hundred other computers. All you'd need would be a home
computer with a modem: the programming would be fairly easy. It could
guess passwords (like "visitor" and "guest") about as well as a
human. And it could run all night long, without anyone nearby.</p>

<p>A momentary panic. Could I prove that I wasn't following such a
machine?</p>

<p>Sure. My hacker made mistakes. Occasional typing errors.</p>

<p>I told Zeke, "There's a human behind that keyboard, all right,
who's not a perfect typist."</p>

<p>"Can you be sure that the hacker's in the same country as the
computer?"</p>

<p>Zeke was on top of this, all right. His questions kept me
thinking. I was watching someone, and my guts said he was in
Germany. But there's no reason why he couldn't be sitting in
Australia, connected into a computer in Germany.</p>

<p>My beeper interrupted my answer. The hacker was back. "Gotta run,
Zeke!"</p>

<p>Down the hall again, into the switchyard. There he was, just
logging in. I started calling Tymnet, but by the time Steve White
answered, the hacker had logged off. Total connect time: thirty
seconds.</p>

<p>Damn. All week long, the hacker had been connecting for a minute or
two at a time. Every time, he triggered my beeper and siphoned off my
adrenaline. But I couldn't trace such short connections. Ten minutes,
for sure. Five minutes, maybe. But not one minute.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Steve didn't mind my panic calls, and each time would
explain a new wrinkle in Tymnet's switching system. Today, however,
Steve mentioned that the Bundespost had talked with the University of
Bremen.</p>

<p>After a meticulous search, the systems folks at the<a id="p180"
name="p180"></a> University of Bremen had discovered a privileged
user: "An expert has created an account for himself, and had root
privileges. He was last active on December 6, and erased all
accounting traces."</p>

<p>Sounded familiar. In fact, the more I read it, the more it said. I
could infer that Bremen used Unix, rather than the VMS operating
system: on Unix computers, people say "root" access; on VMS, it's
"system" privileges. Same concept, different jargon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the German Bundespost had determined the account that
the hacker used to connect across the Atlantic. They set a trap on
that account: the next time someone used that account, they'd trace
the call.</p>

<p>The man at the Bundespost thought the account might be
stolen. Instead of asking the account owner if he'd authorized the
hacker to call America, the Bundespost would quietly watch what was
going on.</p>

<p>The Germans weren't sitting around. The University would monitor
the suspicious account, and the Bundespost watched the network
activity. More and more mouse holes were being watched.</p>

<p>Within an hour, Steve received one more message from Germany: the
University of Bremen will be shutting down its computers for the next
three weeks. Christmas break.</p>

<p>Maybe this was good news. If the hacker didn't show up during the
break, he was likely from Bremen. But if he continued despite the
break, he'd have to pick a different route . . . one that might lead
directly to him.</p>

<p>The hacker wasn't more than a few minutes from Berkeley. Now, we
were only a couple weeks from him.</p>

<h3>34</h3>

<p class="first">December was time to print greeting cards and my
housemates got together for our annual ink splash. Martha drew the
design and Claudia and I cut the silk screens. We figured that we'd
avoid offending our zealot friends by keeping the card astronomical:
Winter Solstice Greetings!<a id="p181" name="p181"></a></p>

<p>"We make cards the way you chase hackers," Martha said.</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Do it yourself," she observed. "Not the way professionals would do
it, but satisfying anyway."</p>

<p>I wondered how a real professional would track this hacker. But
then, who <em>were</em> the professionals? Was anyone dedicated to
following people breaking into computers? I hadn't met them. I'd
called every agency I could think of, yet nobody had taken
over. Nobody had even offered advice.</p>

<p>All the same, the FBI, CIA, OSI, and NSA were fascinated. A
foreigner was siphoning data from U.S. databases. The case was
documented&#8212;not just by my logbook, but also by massive
printouts, phone traces, and network addresses. My monitoring station
ran full time&#8212;the chances for catching the culprit seemed
good.</p>

<p>But not a dime of support. My salary was skimmed from astronomy and
physics grants, and lab management leaned on me for systems support,
not counterespionage. Eight thousand miles away, a hacker was prying
around our networks. Three thousand miles east, some secret agents
were analyzing my latest reports. But two floors up, my bosses wanted
to slam the door.</p>

<p>"Cliff, we've decided to call it quits," Roy Kerth said. "I know
you're close to finding the hacker, but we can't afford it
anymore."</p>

<p>"How about another two weeks. Until New Year's Day?"</p>

<p>"No. Close things up tomorrow. Revoke everyone's passwords tomorrow
afternoon." In other words, slam the door.</p>

<p>Damn. Three, nearly four months work down the tubes. And just when
the trace seemed promising.</p>

<p>Frustrating. The hacker could hide, but he couldn't shake me. My
management was the only one who could do that. Just as we were zeroing
in on the bastard.</p>

<p>Depressing as well. The hacker wouldn't have any trouble returning
to his haunts. He would still roam the networks, breaking in wherever
he could. Nobody cared.</p>

<p>I began planning how to pull every user's password. It's easy to
do&#8212;just rebuild the password file. But how do you tell passwords
to twelve hundred scientists? Bring them together in one room? Call
everyone on the phone? Mail them notes?<a id="p182" name="p182"></a> I
was still bummed out when Mike Gibbons called from the FBI.</p>

<p>"Just checking to see where the trace has led."</p>

<p>"Into Bremen," I said. "A university there."</p>

<p>"So it's a college student, huh?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. But we'll never find out."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"LBL is closing its doors. Tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You can't do that," the FBI agent said. "We're opening an
investigation."</p>

<p>"My boss thinks he can."</p>

<p>"Tell him that we're just making contacts in Europe. Whatever you
do, don't stop now."</p>

<p>"You're talking to the wrong guy, Mike."</p>

<p>"OK. What's your boss's phone number?"</p>

<p>I wasn't about to draw fire from Roy Keith by asking for another
extension. If the FBI really wanted us to stay open, let them deal
with him.</p>

<p>Anyway, nobody was supporting me. All those fancy three-letter
agencies ever said was, "Gimme." Every agency wanted copies of logs
and printouts. Every time we completed a trace, four or five people
demanded to know where it led.</p>

<p>These were the facts of life in dealing with a bureaucracy:
everyone wanted to know what we discovered, but nobody would take
responsibility. Nobody volunteered to be the contact point, the center
for collecting and distributing information. I'd started out in the
center of the study, and it seemed like I'd stay there.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since nobody told me what to do, I could take
chances&#8212;like remaining open to a hacker who could wipe out my
computer in a couple seconds. I could be a one-man band, as in grad
school: if it's worth doing, do it for yourself, not to please some
funding agency.</p>

<p>If only I could keep Kerth and company off my back.</p>

<p>The FBI did that. Mike Gibbons talked to Roy Kerth. I'm not sure
what they said, but half an hour later, Roy told me to remain open for
the next few weeks.</p>

<p>"They're finally taking us seriously," Roy said.</p>

<p>"Serious enough to pay our overhead?"</p>

<p>"Are you kidding?"<a id="p183" name="p183"></a></p>

<p>Rescued from the brink. We'd stay open, though only through the
grace of an informal agreement. I had a couple more weeks to catch the
hacker.</p>

<p>I might not need much more. Friday, December 19, at 1:38, the
hacker showed up again. Stayed around for two hours, fishing on the
Milnet.</p>

<p>A pleasant Friday afternoon, trying to guess passwords to the
Strategic Air Command, the European Milnet Gateway, the Army's West
Point Geography Department, and seventy other assorted military
computers.</p>

<p>I got to the monitors within a few seconds, and phoned Steve White
at Tymnet. He was getting ready to go home when I called.</p>

<p>"The hacker's on our computer. Tymnet's logical port number
14."</p>

<p>"OK," Steve said. The usual keyboard clatter in the
background. Twenty seconds elapsed, and he called out, "Got it!"</p>

<p>Steve had traced a connection from California to Germany in less
than a minute.</p>

<p>"How'd you do that?"</p>

<p>Steve laughed. "Now that I know you're looking for traces, I've
automated my tracing program. I just have to tell it to fly."</p>

<p>"Where's it point to?"</p>

<p>"You're getting a call from address 2624 DNIC 4511 dash
049136."</p>

<p>"What's that mean?"</p>

<p>"We'll have to ask the Bundespost, but I can tell you a bit about
the address. The first digits, 2624, mean Germany."</p>

<p>"We already know that."</p>

<p>"The next four digits, 4511, begin with a 4. That means the
hacker's coming through a public dial-in port."</p>

<p>"I don't understand. What's different from the last time you traced
the hacker?"</p>

<p>"Last time, we traced him to a computer at the University of
Bremen. That time, the digits were 5421. The 5 means that a computer
was at the other end."</p>

<p>Oh&#8212;the address was coded, like American pay telephones, whose
phone numbers always seem to have a fourth digit of 9.<a id="p184"
name="p184"></a></p>

<p>"So the connection isn't coming from the University of Bremen's
computer?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That's for certain. But we know more than that. We know that the
hacker's coming into a dial-in port. He's connecting from a local
telephone."</p>

<p>"Do you know his phone number?"</p>

<p>"No, but the Bundespost can determine what telephone number he
called."</p>

<p>Steve's news brought us one step closer. The hacker couldn't hide
behind the University of Bremen.</p>

<p>"So when will we find the location of this electronic address?"</p>

<p>"Should be soon. I asked Wolfgang to look it up."</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Wolfgang Hoffman. The Datex network manager in Germany."</p>

<p>"You're on the phone with him?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," Steve said. "We're sending electronic mail to each
other." I could have guessed.</p>

<p>"And he hasn't decoded today's address, huh?"</p>

<p>"That's right. Until the Bundespost decodes the address, we can't
do much . . . hold on, something's showing up . . . it's a message
from Germany." Steve apparently had a direct line to Europe, and
passed notes between countries the way I might dash off an interoffice
memo.</p>

<p>Steve translated the note. "Wolfgang says the hacker came from a
dial-in port. He's dialed in over a telephone line."</p>

<p>"We knew that already."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but he's not coming from Bremen. Today, he's dialing from
Hannover."</p>

<p>"So where is he? In Bremen or Hannover?"</p>

<p>"Wolfgang doesn't know. For all we know, he could be in Paris,
calling long distance."</p>

<p>Another dash to the library. Their atlas showed the city of
Hannover, maybe seventy-five miles south of Bremen. Looked like a big
city, around half a million people. Jeez&#8212; the stuff that
travelogues are made from.</p>

<p>Was some student in Bremen dialing Hannover? Not likely. Even with
the university closed, he could just call<a id="p185" name="p185"></a>
Bremen's Datex port. A Bremen student wouldn't make a long-distance
call to Hannover.</p>

<p>Aah, but when the university closed up, students go home.</p>

<p>Was I following some sophomore, home on vacation?</p>

<p>But it didn't feel like a student. College students don't have
six-month attention spans. They'd search for games and academic
programs, not military keywords. And wouldn't a student leave some
kind of signature or joke behind&#8212; some way of sticking out his
tongue at us?</p>

<p>If this wasn't a student, then why did he come from two places in
Germany? Maybe he knew some way to call long distance into
Hannover&#8212;perhaps from some unprotected computer, or with a
stolen credit card. Yesterday it was Bremen. Today Hannover. Where
will he hide tomorrow?</p>

<p>The only way to find out was to keep watching. Quietly.</p>

<p>I'd waited four months. I could wait a while longer.</p>

<h3>35</h3>

<p class="first">"You need a German search warrant."</p>

<p>Steve White called back from Tymnet. He'd just received electronic
mail from Wolfgang Hoffman at the German Bundespost. Wolfgang was hot
to pursue the hacker, but needed legal support to trace their
lines.</p>

<p>"How do I get a search warrant in Germany?" I asked Steve.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but the Bundespost says they're going to the
Hannover courts tomorrow to discuss it."</p>

<p>This was good news. Somewhere in Germany, Wolfgang Hoffman had
started wheels turning. With luck, they'd get some court orders, make
a couple more traces, and arrest the varmint.</p>

<p>Steve White was less optimistic. "When the hacker shows up, the
Germans will have to trace the Datex networks, find the phone number
that the hacker is calling, and then trace that telephone line."</p>

<p>"Foo," I said, remembering my traces in Berkeley and<a id="p186"
name="p186"></a> Virginia. Unless Wolfgang and his team were patient,
competent, and clever, the hacker would evade them.</p>

<p>Too many things could go wrong. The hacker could be from another
country. He could be using a phone line from another city, disguised
through a wide-area telephone system. The court might not grant the
search warrants. Or the hacker might sniff the wind and realize that
someone was on his trail.</p>

<p>Wolfgang sent another message: "Until the search warrant appears,
we will record the name of the Datex user-identifier."</p>

<p>Steve explained, "Whenever you use Tymnet or Datex, someone pays
for the service. When you use the network, you have to type in your
account number and password. The Germans are going to find out who's
paying for the hacker's connections. When we signal them that the
hacker's around, they'll not only trace their Datex network, but also
find the account name that's paying for the connection."</p>

<p>I understood. If the hacker had stolen someone else's account
number and password, he could be charged with theft, and getting a
search warrant would be easy. On the other hand, if he was paying for
his own connections, it would be easy to find his name, and a court
order wouldn't be necessary. They might not even have to trace his
telephone lines.</p>

<p>No doubt, this guy Wolfgang was sharp. He was looking for shortcuts
to avoid making telephone traces. At the same time, he was building a
case against the hacker.</p>

<p>Saturday, December 20, Steve called me at home. Martha glared at me
for letting brunch get cold.</p>

<p>Steve had just received another message from Germany. The
Bundespost had contacted the Bremen State Prosecutor, Herr
Staatsanwalt Von Vock. ("Now that's a high-class title," I
thought.)</p>

<p>The message from Germany read: "The German State Prosecutor needs
to contact high-level U.S. criminal justice persons so as to execute
proper search warrants. The Bundespost cannot move until officially
notified by a high-level U.S. criminal office."</p>

<p>What's a high-level U.S. criminal office? The Mafia? Whatever they
meant, I'd better get people moving.<a id="p187" name="p187"></a></p>

<p>I called my boss, Roy Kerth, who crustily observed that it'd taken
the Germans six months to discover this problem. "If they were half
competent, the hacker would be behind bars by now."</p>

<p>To catch this snake, we all had to pull in the same direction. My
boss's flames didn't promote harmony, so how could they promote
international cooperation? Maybe I'd be better off appealing to our
legal counsel.</p>

<p>Aletha Owens knew what to do. "I'll call Germany and talk to them
directly. They probably need someone in the FBI, but I'll start things
moving."</p>

<p>"Sprechen Sie Deutsch?"</p>

<p>"Not in twenty years," Aletha said. "But I'll haul out the old
Berlitz tapes."</p>

<p>Sunday morning, Aletha called back. "Hey, my German isn't so bad. A
few problems with the future tense, but not bad. Not bad."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but what did you learn?"</p>

<p>"Well, I learned all sorts of things about reflexive verbs and
. . ."</p>

<p>"What about the hacker?"</p>

<p>"Oh, him. Aah, yes." Aletha adopted a mock academic tone. "The
German State Prosecutor is a most kindly gentleman who believes in
protecting both liberty and property. So he needs an official request
to open an investigation."</p>

<p>"Who's the official?"</p>

<p>"The FBI. We've got to ask the FBI to contact their German
counterparts. Or should I say, 'you,' since I'll be gone next
week."</p>

<p>It was on my shoulders to get the FBI to call the Germans to open
an investigation. Great&#8212;another chance for them to say 'go away
kid.' I left a message for Mike Gibbons at the Alexandria, Virginia,
FBI office.</p>

<p>Amazingly, Mike called ten minutes later from Colorado.</p>

<p>"Hi, Cliff. This had better be important."</p>

<p>"Sorry to bother you, but the German prosecutor needs to talk to
someone in the FBI. We've traced our troubles into Hannover."</p>

<p>"Well there's nothing I can do tonight," Mike said. "And I don't
have any documentation here."<a id="p188" name="p188"></a></p>

<p>In theory, the FBI's representative in Germany would contact his
German counterpart, and things would progress from there. Mike said
that this guy, the U.S. Legal Attach&#233; lived in Bonn and handled
communications between the two countries. In a sense, he represents
the FBI within Germany.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, I would often hear about the U.S. Legal
Attach&#233;. I never learned his name, though plenty of curses were
directed his way.</p>

<p>The next day, Mike fished through the crime laws. "It's covered by
the computer fraud act. Open and shut case."</p>

<p>"But the guy has never set foot in the States," I observed. "How
can you get someone from another country?"</p>

<p>"Well, he probably won't be extradited, if that's what you
mean. But we can press charges and get him thrown into a German
prison, especially if the German law is similar to ours."</p>

<p>"What's the likelihood that the FBI will drop the whole thing?"</p>

<p>"Not if I can help it," Mike said. "We'll have to work with
attorneys at the Justice Department, but I don't see a problem
there."</p>

<p>I still didn't believe him. The case was obvious to me, but too
complex to describe to a criminal lawyer.</p>

<p>"Is there anything that I can get that will help you?"</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, there is. Could you write up a summary of the
hacker? You know, draw up a profile of him and tell us who we're
looking for. Things like when he's active, what he's expert in, any
idiosyncrasies. Don't speculate, but try to identify our man."</p>

<p>Here was a useful project to keep me from pestering Mike for a few
days. I combed through my logbook and drew together a profile of my
hacker.</p>

<p>Compiling this profile should have kept me out of trouble for a few
days. But trouble came from another front.</p>

<p>Someone at NSA had leaked word of my research to the Department of
Energy. In turn, they were pissed that they hadn't heard
earlier&#8212;and more directly.</p>

<p>Roy Kerth stopped me in the hallway. "DOE is going to reprimand us
for not telling them about this incident."<a id="p189"
name="p189"></a></p>

<p>"But we did tell them," I objected. "More than two months ago."</p>

<p>"Prove it."</p>

<p>"Sure. It's in my logbook."</p>

<p>Roy wanted to see it, so we walked over to my Macintosh and brought
up the logbook. Sure enough, on November 12th, my logbook said that
I'd informed DOE. I'd written a summary of our conversation and even
included a phone number. DOE couldn't complain&#8212;we could prove
that we'd informed them.</p>

<p>Saved by my logbook.</p>

<p>Just like observing at a telescope. If you don't document it, you
might as well not have observed it. Sure, you need powerful telescopes
and computers. But without a logbook, your observations won't amount
to much.</p>

<p>On December 30, my beeper woke me up around 5 a.m. By reflex, I
called Steve at his house. He wasn't pleased to hear from me.</p>

<p>"The hacker's on."</p>

<p>" Aaw, I was just in the middle of a dream. Are you sure it's him?"
His British accent didn't hide his annoyance.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, but I'll find out in a minute."</p>

<p>"OK, I'll start a trace." Steve put up with a lot from me.</p>

<p>From home, I dialed my Unix computer. Damn. No hacker. The
electricians had tripped my alarm by shutting off a nearby
computer.</p>

<p>Sheepishly, I called Steve back.</p>

<p>"Say, Cliff, I can't find anyone connected to your computer." His
voice was still sleepy.</p>

<p>"Yeah. It's a false alarm. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"No problem. Maybe next time, huh?"</p>

<p>Now here's a good guy. If someone I'd never met rousted me out of
bed to chase a phantom in a computer . . .</p>

<p>Luckily, only Steve had heard me cry wolf. What would happen to my
credibility if I'd passed the word along to Germany or the FBI? From
now on, I'd double-check every alarm.<a id="p190" name="p190"></a></p>

<h3>36</h3>

<p class="first">New Year's Eve found us sitting around the fire with
friends, sipping eggnog and listening to the explosions as
neighborhood idiots set off cherry bombs in the street.</p>

<p>"Hey," said Martha, "we'd better get moving if we're going to make
it to First Night." San Francisco was throwing a city-wide party to
welcome in 1987, foster civic pride, and give people an alternative to
getting drunk and smashing into each other. There was music, dance,
theater, and comedy in a dozen locations across town, with cable-car
shuttles between events.</p>

<p>Seven of us piled into a beat-up Volvo and inched into San
Francisco, trapped in a raucous traffic jam. Instead of honking,
people blew party horns out their car windows. Finally we came to the
brightly lit city, ditched the car, and headed for a flamenco
concert.</p>

<p>We found our way to the Mission district&#8212;the Latin section of
town, and discovered a packed Catholic church with an impatient
audience. A sheepish face emerged from behind the curtain, explaining,
"None of the lights work so we're delaying the performance."</p>

<p>Amid the catcalls and boos, Martha stood up and pushed me
forward. I still had my electrician's license, and she'd done tech for
many an amateur theatrical. We snuck backstage. The flamenco dancers
in their glittering costumes smoked and paced the dark stage like
caged tigers, tapping their feet and glancing at us doubtfully. Martha
set about untangling the maze of cables strewn in the wings while I
located the blown fuse. A quick swap of fuses and, shazam, the stage
lights lit.</p>

<p>The dancers stamped and cheered and, as Martha neatly coiled the
last cable and adjusted the lighting board, the emcee dragged us on
stage to thank us. After we escaped the limelight, we enjoyed the
flamenco dancing and <em>faro</em> singing; the scowling, nervous
creatures we'd seen on the dark stage were transformed into elegant,
whirling dancers.<a id="p191" name="p191"></a></p>

<p>We ducked outside and found a shuttle bus driven by an old lady who
could have passed for Tugboat Annie, in appearance and language. She
maneuvered the bus gamely through the crowded streets, and we found
ourselves at the Women's Building on Eighteenth Street. There the
Wallflower Order danced and told stories of feminism and social
protest.</p>

<p>One dance was about the Wu-Shu, a legendary Chinese monkey who
defeated the greedy warlords and gave land back to the people. Sitting
in the balcony, I thought about politically correct monkeys&#8212;was
I a pawn of the warlords? Or was I really a clever monkey, on the side
of the people? I couldn't tell, so I forgot about my hacker and
enjoyed the dance.</p>

<p>Finally, we wound up dancing wildly to a rhythm and blues band with
lead singer Maxine Howard, a sensational blues singer and the sexiest
woman in the history of the world. She was picking people out of the
audience to dance with her on the stage, and we soon found ourselves
hoisting a protesting Martha onto the platform. Within a few minutes,
she and her fellow victims overcame their stage fright and formed
themselves into a fairly synchronized chorus line, doing little hand
motions like the Supremes. I was never much for dancing, but by two
o'clock or so, I found myself jumping and spinning around with Martha,
lifting her high in the air ...</p>

<p>We finally had our fill of high culture and cheap thrills, and went
to sleep at a friend's house in the Mission district. What felt like
moments after my head touched the pillow (though it was actually nine
the next morning), my beeper woke me up.</p>

<p>Huh? The hacker was at work on New Year's Day? Give me a break.</p>

<p>There wasn't much I could do. Hacker or not, I wasn't about to call
Steve White on New Year's morning. Anyway, I doubted that the German
Bundespost could do much about it on a holiday. Most of all, I was ten
miles from my laboratory.</p>

<p>I felt caged in while the hacker had free run. If he wanted to
tweak my nose, he'd found the way. Just show up when I couldn't do
anything.<a id="p192" name="p192"></a></p>

<p>Well, I couldn't do much beyond worry, so I tried to sleep. With
Martha's arm around me, rest came easily. "C'mon, sweetie," she
purred. "Give the hacker a holiday." I sank into the pillows. Hacker
or not, we would celebrate the New Year. We slept the rest of the
morning. Around noon, we found our way back home. Claudia greeted us
with a violin sonata . . . she'd spent New Year's Eve playing at some
millionaire's party.</p>

<p>Martha asked about her job. "You should have seen the
canap&#233;s!" Claudia answered. "We had to sit and stare at them
for <em>hours</em> before they finally saw us looking pathetic and
brought us some. They had a whole smoked salmon and caviar and
strawberries dipped in chocolate and&#8212;"</p>

<p>Martha cut in, "I meant what music you played."</p>

<p>"Oh, we played that Mozart sonata everyone likes that goes diddle
dum diddle da da da. Then they started making requests for really icky
things like 'My Wild Irish Rose.' I thought I'd get sick but after all
it was $125 for two hours and it was on the way to my mom's so I could
drop the dog off there, and do some shopping up at Santa
Rosa&#8212;"</p>

<p>Martha snuck in a word about brunch. We were all in the kitchen
mixing waffle batter and making fruit salad when my beeper
sounded.</p>

<p>Damn. The hacker again. Martha cursed, but I hardly heard her: I
zipped over to my Macintosh and dialed the lab.</p>

<p>There was the hacker, all right, logged in as Sventek. It looked
like he was using the Milnet, but I couldn't be sure until I went to
the lab. Meanwhile, I'd better call Steve White at Tymnet.</p>

<p>No time&#8212;the hacker disappeared within a minute. He was
playing New Year's games.</p>

<p>There wasn't much to do but pick up the pieces. I scarfed down the
waffles and hiked over to the lab. There, the hacker's New Year's
celebration was saved on my printers. I scribbled notes on the
printouts, next to each of his commands.</p>

<p>Well, I'd never come across such things. I'd always thought that a
theater was somewhere to watch movies, not a place to develop nuclear
forces. This hacker wasn't playing games.</p>

<p>And he wasn't satisfied with the titles to these documents&#8212;
he dumped all twenty-nine over the line printer. Page after page was
filled with army double-talk like:</p>

<pre>
TITLE: Nuclear, chemical, and biological national security affairs

DESCRIPTION: Documents relating to domestic, foreign, and military
police for the application of atomic energy, utilization of nuclear
and chemical weapons, and biological defense relating to national
security and national level crises management. Included are studies,
actions, and directives of and related to the President, National
Security Council, Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, and interdepartmental groups and committees addressing

</pre>

<p>There, my printer jammed. The old Decwriter had paid its dues for
ten years, and now needed an adjustment with a sledge
hammer. Damn. Right where the hacker listed the Army's plans for
nuclear bombs in the Central European theater, there was only an ink
blot.</p>

<p>I didn't know much about movie theaters in Central Europe, so I
gave Greg Fennel a call at the CIA. Amazingly, he answered his phone
on New Year's Day.</p>

<p>"Hi, Greg&#8212;what brings you in on New Year's?"</p>

<p>"You know, the world never sleeps."</p>

<p>"Hey, what do you know about movie houses in Central Europe?" I
asked, playing the fool.<a id="p196" name="p196"></a></p>

<p>"Oh, a bit. What's up?"</p>

<p>"Not much. The hacker just broke into some Army computer at the
Pentagon."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with movies?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," I said, "but he seemed especially interested in nuclear
force structure developments in Central European theaters."</p>

<p>"You dunce! That's Army tactical warfare plans. Jeez. How did he
get it?"</p>

<p>"His usual techniques. Guessed the password to the Army Optimis
database in the Pentagon. It looks like a bibliography of Army
documents."</p>

<p>"What else did he get?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell. My printer jammed. But he searched for keywords like
'SDI,' 'Stealth,' and 'SAC.' "</p>

<p>"Comic book stuff." I wasn't sure if Greg was joking or serious. He
probably thought the same of me.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, how did the spooks know if I was putting them
on? For all they knew, I might be inventing everything. Greg had no
reason to trust me&#8212;I had no clearance, no badge, not even a
trench coat. Unless they were spying behind my back, my credibility
remained untested.</p>

<p>I had only one defense against this quicksand of distrust&#8212;
the facts.</p>

<p>But even if they believed me, they weren't likely to do
anything. Greg explained, "We can't just send Teejay overseas and bust
down someone's door, you know."</p>

<p>"But can't you, well, sorta snoop around there and find out who's
responsible for this?" I imagined spies in trench coats again.</p>

<p>Greg laughed. "That's not how things work. Trust me&#8212; we're
working on it. And this latest news will add fuel to the fire." So
much for the CIA. I just couldn't tell if they were interested or
not.</p>

<p>On January 2, I called the Alexandria FBI office and tried to leave
a message for Mike Gibbons. The duty agent who answered the phone said
in a dry voice, "Agent Gibbons is no longer working this case. We
suggest you contact the Oakland office."</p>

<p>Super. The only FBI agent that knows the difference<a id="p197"
name="p197"></a> between a network and a nitwit has been pulled off
the case. No explanation given.</p>

<p>And just when we need the FBI. Wolfgang was still waiting for a
warrant from the U.S. Legal Attach&#233; in Bonn. A week of waiting,
and it still hadn't come through. Time to knock on another door.</p>

<p>No doubt the National Security Agency would want to know about
leaks from a Pentagon computer. Zeke Hanson at Fort Meade
answered.</p>

<p>"Did the Army information go directly to Europe?" Zeke asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, though I don't know exactly where," I said. "Looks like
Germany."</p>

<p>"Do you know which International Record Carrier they used?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, I don't. But I can fish it out of my records if it's that
important." Why would NSA want to know who had carried this
traffic?</p>

<p>Of course. NSA is rumored to tape-record every transatlantic
telephone conversation. Maybe they'd recorded this session.</p>

<p>But that's impossible. How much information crosses the Atlantic
every day? Oh, say there's ten satellites and a half-dozen
transatlantic cables. Each handles ten thousand telephone calls. So
the NSA would need several hundred thousand tape recorders running
full time. And that's just to listen to the phone traffic&#8212;there
are computer messages and television as well. Why, fishing out my
particular session would be nearly impossible, even with
supercomputers to help. But there was an easy way to find out. See if
NSA could obtain the missing data.</p>

<p>"The New Year's Day sessions were interrupted by a paper jam," I
told Zeke, "so I'm missing an hour of the hacker's work. Think you
could recover it?"</p>

<p>Zeke was cagey. "What's its importance?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't quite say, since I haven't seen it. The session
started at 8:47 on New Year's Day. Why don't you see if someone in
Ft. Meade can find the rest of the traffic from this session?"</p>

<p>"Unlikely at best."</p>

<p>The NSA was always willing to listen but clammed up<a id="p198"
name="p198"></a> tight whenever I asked questions. Still, if they were
doing their homework, they'd have to call me and see if our results
were the same. I waited for someone to ask to see our printout. Nobody
did.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, two weeks ago, I'd asked Zeke Hanson at the
NSA to find out an electronic address. When I first traced a line into
Europe, I passed the address to Zeke. I wondered what he'd done with
it.</p>

<p>"Did you ever find out where that DNIC address comes from?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Cliff, that information is unavailable." Zeke sounded like
one of those Magic-8 balls, the kind that say, "Reply hazy, ask again
later."</p>

<p>Fortunately, Tymnet had already figured out the address ... it only
took Steve White a couple hours.</p>

<p>Perhaps NSA has lots of electronics wizards and computer geniuses,
listening to the world's communications. I wonder. Here, I'd presented
them with two fairly easy problems&#8212;find an address and replay
some traffic. Maybe they did, but they never told me a whit. I suspect
they do nothing, hiding behind a veil of secrecy.</p>

<p>Well, there was one more group to inform. The Air Force OSI. The
Air Force narcs couldn't do much about the hacker, but at least they
could figure out whose computer was wide open.</p>

<p>Jim Christy's gravelly voice crackled over the phone lines: "So
it's the Army Optimis system, huh? I'll make a few calls and bang a
few heads." I hoped he was joking.</p>

<p>So 1987 started on a sour note. The hacker still had the free run
of our computers. The only competent FBI agent had been pulled from
the case. The spooks wouldn't say a thing, and NSA seemed
uninspired. If we didn't make some headway soon, I'd give up
too.<a id="p199" name="p199"></a></p>

<h3>37</h3>

<p class="first">Around noon on Sunday, January 4, Martha and I were
stitching a quilt when my beeper sounded. I jumped for the computer,
checked that the hacker was around, then called Steve White. Within a
minute, he'd started the trace.</p>

<p>I didn't wait while Steve tracked the call. The hacker was on my
computer, so I hiked up to the lab and watched from there. Another
twenty-minute race up the hill, but the hacker took his time: he was
still typing when I reached the switchyard.</p>

<p>Underneath the printer, an inch-thick printout had accumulated. The
hacker hadn't been lazy today. The top line showed him masquerading
behind Sventek's name. After checking that none of our system managers
were around, he went back to the Pentagon's Optimis database. Not
today: "You are not authorized to log in today," was the Army
computer's reply.</p>

<p>Well, hot ziggity! Jim Christy must have bashed the right
heads.</p>

<p>Scanning the printout, I could see the hacker going fishing on the
Milnet. One by one, he tried fifteen Air Force computers, at places
like Eglin, Kirtland, and Bolling Air Force Bases. No luck. He'd
connect to each computer, twist the doorknob once or twice, then go on
to the next system.</p>

<p>Until he tried the Air Force Systems Command, Space Division.</p>

<p>He first twisted on their doorknob by trying their System account,
with the password of "Manager." No luck.</p>

<p>Then Guest, password of "Guest." No effect.</p>

<p>Then Field, password "Service":</p>

<p>Shazam: the door had swung wide open. He'd logged in as Field
Service. Not just an ordinary user. A completely privileged
account.</p>

<p>The hacker couldn't believe his luck. After dozens of attempts,
he'd made the big time. System operator.</p>

<p>His first command was to show what privileges he'd garnered. The
Air Force computer responded automatically: System Privilege, and a
slew of other rights, including the ability to read, write, or erase
any file on the system.</p>

<p>He was even authorized to run security audits on the Air Force
computer.</p>

<p>I could imagine him sitting behind his terminal in Germany, staring
in disbelief at the screen. He didn't just have free run of the Space
Command's computer; he controlled it.</p>

<p>Somewhere in Southern California, in El Segundo, a big<a id="p201"
name="p201"></a> Vax computer was being invaded by a hacker halfway
around the world.</p>

<p>His next moves weren't surprising: after showing his privileges, he
disabled the auditing for his jobs. This way, he left no footprints
behind; at least he thought not. How could he know that I was watching
from Berkeley?</p>

<p>Confident that he was undetected, he probed the nearby
computers. In a moment, he'd discovered four on the Air Force network,
and a pathway to connect to others. From his high ground, none of
these were hidden from him; if their passwords weren't guessable, he
could steal them by setting up Trojan horses.</p>

<p>This wasn't a little desktop computer he'd broken into. He found
thousands of files on the system, and hundreds of users. Hundreds of
users? Yep. The hacker listed them all.</p>

<p>But his greediness got in his way. He commanded the Air Force
computer to list the names of all its files; it went merrily along
typing out names like "Laser-design-plans" and
"Shuttle-launch-manifest." But he didn't know how to shut off the
spigot. For two hours, it poured a Niagara of information onto his
terminal.</p>

<p>Finally, at 2:30, he hung up, figuring that he'd just log back into
the Air Force computer. But he couldn't get back on. The Air Force
computer informed him:</p>

<pre>
"Your password has expired Please contact the system manager."
</pre>

<p>Looking back over the printout, I realized his goof. The Air Force
computer had expired the "field service" password; he'd received a
warning when he first broke in. Probably, the system automatically
expired passwords after a few months.</p>

<p>To stay on the machine, he should have immediately reset his
password. Instead, he ignored the request. Now the system wouldn't let
him back.</p>

<p>From thousands of miles away, I could sense his frustration. He
desperately wanted to get back into that computer, but he'd been
foiled by his own stupid mistake.</p>

<p>He'd stumbled on the keys to a Buick, and locked them in the
car.</p>

<p>The hacker's mistake solved one problem: what should I<a id="p202"
name="p202"></a> tell the Air Force Space Division? Since it was a
Sunday, there was nobody to call today. And because the hacker had
locked himself out, he was no longer a danger to the Air Force
computer. I'd just report the problem to the Air Force narcs, and let
them handle it.</p>

<p>While the hacker stepped through the Air Force computer, Steve
White traced Tymnet's lines.</p>

<p>"He's coming through RCA," Steve said. "TAT-6."</p>

<p>"Huh? What's that mean in English?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing really. RCA is one of the international record
carriers, and today the hacker is coming across the number six
transatlantic cable." Steve dealt in worldwide communications like a
taxi driver in midtown traffic.</p>

<p>"Why isn't he on a satellite link?"</p>

<p>"Probably because it's a Sunday&#8212;the cable channels are less
crowded."</p>

<p>"You mean that people prefer cable to satellite links?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Every time you connect through a satellite, there's a
quarter-second delay. The undersea cables don't slow down your
messages so much."</p>

<p>"Who would care?"</p>

<p>"People on the telephone, mostly," Steve said. "Those delays make
for jittery conversations. You know, where each person tries to speak
at the same time, then they both back off."</p>

<p>"So if the phone companies try to route over the cables, who wants
the satellites?"</p>

<p>"Television networks, mostly. TV signals can't be squeezed into
submarine cables, so they grab the satellites. But fiber optics will
change everything."</p>

<p>I'd heard of fiber optics. Running communications signals over
strands of glass, instead of copper wires. But who was running
fiber-optic cables under the ocean?</p>

<p>"Everyone wants to," Steve explained. "There's a limited number of
satellite channels available&#8212;you can crowd only so many
satellites over Equador. And the satellite channels aren't
private&#8212;anyone can listen in. Satellites may be fine for
television, but cable's the way to go for data."</p>

<p>My conversations with Steve White began with tracing the hacker,
but inevitably slipped into other topics. A short talk with Steve
usually became a tutorial on communications theory.<a id="p203"
name="p203"></a></p>

<p>Realizing that the hacker was still connected, I asked Steve for
the details of the trace.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah. I checked with Wolfgang Hoffman at the Bundespost. Your
visitor is coming from Karlsruhe today. The University of
Karlsruhe."</p>

<p>"Where's that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I'd guess the Ruhr valley. Isn't that along the
Rhine?"</p>

<p>The hacker was still chipping away at the Air Force computer, but
after he left, I jogged over to the library. Yes, there's
Karlsruhe. Three hundred miles south of Hannover.</p>

<p>Draped across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, the TAT-6 cable ties
together Europe and America. The western end of the connection came
through Tymnet, then Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, across the Milnet,
and ended at the Air Force Systems Command Space Division.</p>

<p>Somewhere in Germany, the hacker tickled the eastern end of the
connection, unaware that we were zeroing in on him.</p>

<p>Three different places in Germany. My hacker was moving around. Or
maybe he was staying in one place, playing a shell game with the
telephone system. Perhaps he really was a student, visiting different
campuses and showing off to his friends. Was I certain that there was
only one hacker&#8212;or was I watching several people?</p>

<p>The solution depended on completing a trace. Not just to a country
or a city, but all the way to an individual. But how do I get a phone
trace from six thousand miles away?</p>

<p>The search warrant! Had the FBI pushed the warrant into Germany?
For that matter, had they really opened an investigation? Time to call
Mike Gibbons of the FBI.</p>

<p>"I hear you've been pulled off the computer case," I told Mike. "Is
there anything I can do?"</p>

<p>"Not to worry," Mike said. "Let me handle it. Just lay low, and
we'll make progress."</p>

<p>"Well, is there an open investigation or not?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, because I can't say. Just be patient, and we'll work
it out."</p>

<p>Mike slipped out of every question. Maybe I could pry some
information from him by telling him about the Air Force
computer.<a id="p204" name="p204"></a></p>

<p>"Hey, the hacker broke into an Air Force computer yesterday."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, somewhere in Southern California." I didn't say that it was at
2400 East El Segundo Boulevard, across from the Los Angeles
Airport. He wouldn't tell me what was happening, so I'd play coy with
him.</p>

<p>"Who runs it?"</p>

<p>"Someone in the Air Force. Sounds like some Buck Rogers place. I
dunno."</p>

<p>"You'd better call the Air Force OSI. They'll know what to do."</p>

<p>"Won't the FBI investigate?"</p>

<p>"I told you. We are investigating. We are making progress. It's
just not for your ears to hear." So much for extracting information
from the FBI.</p>

<p>The Air Force narcs were a bit more expressive. Jim Christy of the
Air Force OSI put it succinctly.</p>

<p>"Systems Command? Son of a bitch."</p>

<p>"Yeah. The guy became system manager there."</p>

<p>"Systems manager at Systems Command. Amusing. Did he get anything
classified?"</p>

<p>"Not that I can tell. He really didn't get that much, just the
names of a few thousand files."</p>

<p>"Damn. We told them. Twice." I wasn't sure if I should be
listening.</p>

<p>"If it makes any difference, he's not going to get back on their
system. He's locked himself out." I told him about the password
expiration.</p>

<p>"That's fine for the Systems Command," Jim said, "but how many
other computers are just as wide open? If the Space Division screws up
like that, even after we warn them, then how are we ever going to get
the word out?"</p>

<p>"You warned them?"</p>

<p>"Damn straight. We've been telling systems operators for six months
to change all their passwords. Don't you think we've been listening to
you?"</p>

<p>Smoley hokes! They'd actually heard my message, and were spreading
the word. It's the first time that anyone had even hinted that I'd had
any effect.</p>

<p>Well, the Air Force OSI in Washington sent the message<a id="p205"
name="p205"></a> out to their agent at Vandenberg Air Force Base. He,
in turn, was to knock heads at the Space Division. They'd make sure
that the hole stayed plugged up.</p>

<p>Two days later, Dave Cleveland and I were sitting in front of his
terminal, playing with some broken software. My beeper went off and
without saying a word, Dave switched the terminal over to the Unix
computer. Sventek was just logging on. We looked at the screen, then
nodded to each other. I jogged over to the switchyard to watch the
action live.</p>

<p>The hacker didn't bother with my computers, but went straight over
the Milnet to the Air Force Space Division. I watched him start to log
in there as Field Service, thinking how he would just be booted off
again.</p>

<p>But no! He was welcomed back into their system. Someone at the Air
Force base had re-enabled the Field Service account with the same old
password. The service technician may have noticed that the account had
expired, and asked the system manager to reset the password.</p>

<p>Stupid. They'd unlocked the doors and left the keys in the
ignition.</p>

<p>The hacker didn't waste a minute. He went straight to the
authorization software and added a new account. No, not a new
account. He searched for an old, unused account and modified it. Some
Air Force officer, Colonel Abrens, had an account, but hadn't been
around this computer in a year.</p>

<p>The hacker slightly modified Colonel Abrens' account, giving it
system privileges and a new password: AFHACK.</p>

<p>AFHACK&#8212;what arrogance. He's thumbing his nose at the United
States Air Force.</p>

<p>From now on, he didn't need the Field Service account. Disguised as
an officer in the Air Force, he had unlimited access to the Space
Division's computer.</p>

<p>Heavy duty. This guy wasn't tinkering around. Air Force OSI had
left for the day. What should I do? Leaving the hacker connected would
leak sensitive information from the Air Force. But disconnecting him
would only cause him to use a different route, bypassing my lab's
monitors.</p>

<p>We'd have to chop him off at the Space Command.</p>

<p>But first, I wanted him traced. A call to Steve White<a id="p206"
name="p206"></a> started things rolling. Within five minutes, he'd
traced the connection to Hannover, and called the Bundespost.</p>

<p>A few minutes of silence. "Cliff, does the connection look like it
will be a long one?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell, but I think so."</p>

<p>"OK." Steve was on another telephone; I could only hear an
occasional shout.</p>

<p>In a minute, Steve returned to my line. "Wolfgang is tracing the
call in Hannover. It's a local call. They're going to try to trace it
all the way."</p>

<p>Here's news! A local call in Hannover meant that the hacker's
somewhere in Hannover.</p>

<p>Unless there's a computer in Hannover doing his dirty work.</p>

<p>Steve shouted instructions from Wolfgang: "Whatever you do, don't
disconnect the hacker. Keep him on the line if you can!"</p>

<p>But he's rifling files at the Air Force base. It was like letting a
burglar rob your home while you watched. Should I boot him out or let
the trace go ahead? I couldn't decide.</p>

<p>Well, I ought to call some authority. How about Mike Gibbons of the
FBI? He's not around.</p>

<p>Hey&#8212;the National Computer Security Center might be a good
place to call. Zeke Hanson will know what to do.</p>

<p>No luck. Zeke wasn't in and the voice at the far end of the line
explained, "I'd like to help you, but we design secure computers. We
don't get involved in the operational aspects." I'd heard that before,
thank you.</p>

<p>Well, there wasn't anyone else to tell but the Air Force. I hooked
into the Milnet Network Information Center and looked up their phone
number. Naturally, they'd changed their phone number. They even listed
the wrong area code. By the time I reached the right person, the
hacker had thoroughly penetrated their computer.</p>

<p>"Hi, I'm looking for the system manager of the Space Command's Vax
computer."</p>

<p>"This is Sergeant Thomas. I'm the manager."</p>

<p>"Uh, I don't know how to explain this to you, but there's a hacker
in your computer." (Meanwhile, I'm thinking, "He won't believe me and
will want to know who I am.")<a id="p207" name="p207"></a></p>

<p>"Huh? Who are you?" Even over the phone, I could feel him giving me
the hairy eyeball.</p>

<p>"I'm an astronomer at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory." (First
mistake, I think, nobody's gonna believe that.)</p>

<p>"How do you know there's a hacker?"</p>

<p>"I'm watching him break into your computer over the Milnet."</p>

<p>"You expect me to believe you?"</p>

<p>"Just look at your system. List out your users."</p>

<p>"OK." I hear typing in the background.</p>

<p>"There's nothing strange here. We've got fifty-seven people logged
in, and the system's behaving normally."</p>

<p>"Notice anyone new?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Let's see ... No, everything's normal." Should I tell him or just
beat around the bush?</p>

<p>"Do you know someone named Abrens?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Colonel Abrens. He's logged in right now. Hey, what are you
getting at?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure that Abrens is legit?"</p>

<p>"Hell, yes. He's a colonel. You don't mess with the brass."</p>

<p>I was getting nowhere by asking leading questions. Might as well
tell him. "Well, a hacker's stolen Abrens' account. He's logged on
right now, and he's dumping your files."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I watched him. I've got a printout," I said. "He came in on the
Field Service account, then reset Abrens' password. Right now, he's
got system privileges."</p>

<p>"That's impossible. Just yesterday, I reset the password to the
Field Service account. It had expired."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. You set the password to 'service.' The same as it's
been for the past year. Hackers know this."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned. Hold on." Over the phone, I hear Sergeant
Thomas call someone over. A couple minutes later, he's back on the
line.</p>

<p>"What do you want us to do?" he asked. "I can shut off my computer
right now."</p>

<p>"No, hold off for a bit," I said. "We're tracing the line right
now, and we're closing in on the hacker." This was no fib: Steve White
had just relayed Wolfgang Hoffman's request to keep the hacker on the
line as long as possible. I<a id="p208" name="p208"></a> didn't want
Sergeant Thomas to cut the line before the trace was complete.</p>

<p>"OK, but we'll call our commanding officer. He'll make the final
decision." I could hardly blame them. A total stranger calls from
Berkeley and tells them that someone's breaking into their system.</p>

<p>Between these phone calls, I watched the printer punch out the
hacker's every command. Today, he didn't list the names of every
file. Quite the contrary: he listed individual files. He already knew
the names of the files he was looking for; he didn't need to scramble
around searching for their names.</p>

<p>Aah. This was an important clue. Three days ago, the hacker listed
the names of a thousand files. Today, he went straight to those files
that interested him. He must have printed out his entire
session. Otherwise, he would have forgotten the names of the
files.</p>

<p>So the hacker's printing out everything he gets. I already knew
that he kept a detailed notebook&#8212;otherwise, he'd have forgotten
some of the seeds that he'd planted months ago. I remembered my
meeting with the CIA: Teejay had wondered if the hacker kept
recordings of his sessions. Now 1 knew.</p>

<p>At the far end of the connection, somewhere in Germany, sat a
determined and methodical spy. Every printout that came across my
monitor was duplicated in his lair.</p>

<p>Which files did he list? He skipped over all the programs and
ignored system management guidelines. Instead, he went for operational
plans. Documents describing Air Force payloads for the space
shuttle. Test results from satellite detection systems. SDI research
proposals. A description of an astronaut-operated camera system.</p>

<p>None of this information had the comment "classified" on it. It
wasn't secret, top secret, or even confidential. At least, none of the
files carried those labels.</p>

<p>Now, no military computer on the Milnet is allowed to carry
classified information. There's another computer network, completely
separate, that handles classified data. So in one sense, the Systems
Command's Space Division had nothing to lose: its computer is
unclassified.</p>

<p>But there's a deeper problem. Individually, public
documents<a id="p209" name="p209"></a> don't contain classified
information. But once you gather many documents together, they may
reveal secrets. An order from an aircraft manufacturer for a load of
titanium sure isn't secret. Nor is the fact that they're building a
new bomber. But taken together, there's a strong indicator that
Boeing's new bomber is made of titanium, and therefore must fly at
supersonic speeds (since ordinary aluminum can't resist high
temperatures).</p>

<p>In the past, to pull together information from diverse sources
you'd spend weeks in a library. Now, with computers and networks, you
can match up data sets in minutes&#8212; look at how I manipulated
Mitre's long-distance phone bills to find where the hacker had
visited. By analyzing public data with the help of computers, people
can uncover secrets without ever seeing a classified database.</p>

<p>Back in 1985 Vice Admiral John Poindexter worried about just this
problem. He tried to create a new classification of information,
"Sensitive but unclassified." Such information fit below the usual
levels of Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential; but access to it was
to be denied to certain foreigners.</p>

<p>Poindexter clumsily tried to apply this to academic
research&#8212;naturally, the universities refused, and the idea
died. Now, standing in front of my monitor, watching the hacker prowl
through the Space Command's system, I realized his meaning. Air Force
SDI projects might not be top secret, but they sure were
sensitive.</p>

<p>What? Me agreeing with Vice Admiral Poindexter? The guy that
shipped arms to Iran? How could I have any common ground with Ollie
North's boss? Yet dancing across my screen was just what he'd
described: sensitive but unclassified data.</p>

<p>Tymnet came back on the line. "I'm sorry, Cliff, but the trace in
Germany is stymied."</p>

<p>"Can't they trace the call?" I asked, unsure of who I meant by
"they."</p>

<p>"Well, the hacker's line comes from Hannover, all right," Steve
replied. "But Hannover's phone lines connect through mechanical
switches&#8212;noisy, complicated widgets&#8212;and these can only be
traced by people. You can't trace the call with a
computer."<a id="p210" name="p210"></a></p>

<p>I started to understand. "You mean that someone has to <em>be</em>
in the telephone exchange to trace the call?"</p>

<p>"That's it. And since it's after 10 P.M. in Hannover, there's
nobody around."</p>

<p>"How long will it take to get someone into the exchange?"</p>

<p>"About three hours."</p>

<p>To trace the line, a Bundespost telephone technician would have to
visit the telephone exchange and follow the switches and wires. For
all I knew, he might even have to climb telephone poles. Bad news.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the hacker was slithering through the Air Force
computer. Sergeant Thomas was still on hold&#8212;he'd probably called
all sorts of Air Force brass by now.</p>

<p>I popped my phone to the Air Force line. "Well, we can't trace
things any further today."</p>

<p>"Gotcha. We'll cut off the hacker right now."</p>

<p>"Wait for a second," I said. "Don't make it look like you're just
booting him off your system. Instead, find a way that he won't suspect
that you're on to him."</p>

<p>"Yeah. We figured out a plan," Sergeant Thomas replied. "We'll
broadcast an announcement to everyone on the system that our
computer's malfunctioning, and will have to be serviced."</p>

<p>Perfect. The hacker will think the system's going down for
repairs.</p>

<p>I waited for a minute and in the middle of a page of SDI proposals,
this message interrupted the hacker's screen:</p>

<pre>
System going down for maintenance, back up in 2 hours.
</pre>

<p>He saw it right away. The hacker immediately logged off and
disappeared into the void.<a id="p211" name="p211"></a></p>

<h3>38</h3>

<p class="first">Having broken into another military base, the hacker
wasn't about to give up. He returned to our lab, trying over and over
to get back into the Air Force Systems Command. But none of his magic
charms worked. He couldn't get back into their computers.</p>

<p>They were clever about how they'd locked out the hacker. They
didn't just post a notice saying, "Hackers stay out". Instead, they
set the hacker's stolen account so that it almost worked. When the
hacker logged into his stolen account, Abrens, the Air Force computer
appeared to accept it, but then barfed back an error message&#8212;as
if the hacker had set up his account incorrectly.</p>

<p>I wondered if the hacker realized that he was under my thumb. Every
time he succeeded in breaking into a computer, he was detected and
booted out.</p>

<p>From his viewpoint, everyone except us detected him. In reality,
almost nobody detected him.</p>

<p>Except us.</p>

<p>He couldn't know that he was caged in. My alarms, monitors, and
electronic tripwires were invisible to him. Tymnet's
traces&#8212;through satellites and under the ocean&#8212; were
totally silent. And the Bundespost was now on his scent.</p>

<p>Wolfgang's latest message said that he was arranging to keep a
technician at the Hannover telephone exchange until midnight every
night. This was expensive, so he needed to coordinate this with
us. More important, the Germans had still not heard from the FBI.</p>

<p>Time to call Mike Gibbons. "The Germans haven't received anything
from the FBI," I said. "Any idea why?"</p>

<p>"We're having, er, internal problems here," Mike replied. "You
don't want to know."</p>

<p>I did want to know, but there was no use asking. Mike wouldn't say
a thing.<a id="p212" name="p212"></a></p>

<p>"What should I tell the Bundespost?" I asked. "They're getting
antsy for some kind of official notification."</p>

<p>"Tell them that the FBI's Legal Attach&#233; in Bonn is handling
everything. The paperwork will come along."</p>

<p>"That's what you said two weeks ago."</p>

<p>"And that's what I'm saying now."</p>

<p>Zip. I passed the message back to Steve at Tymnet, who forwarded it
to Wolfgang. The bureaucrats might not be able to communicate with
each other, but the technicians sure did.</p>

<p>Our complaints to the FBI should have been filtered through their
office, sent to the American Legal Attach&#233; in Bonn, then passed
to the German FBI, the Bundeskriminalamt. The BKA probably inspires
the same image of truth and justice in Germany as the FBI does in
America.</p>

<p>But someone was plugging up the communications downstream of Mike
Gibbons. About all I could do was keep pestering Mike, and stay in
close touch with Tymnet and the Bundespost. Sooner or later, the FBI
would reach out to the BKA, and the warrants would appear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my astronomer buddies needed help. I spent the day
trying to understand the optics of the Keck Observatory's
telescope. Jerry Nelson needed my programs to predict the telescope's
performance; I hadn't made a whit of progress since I'd started
chasing the hacker.</p>

<p>The other systems programmers were on my case, too. Crusty Wayne
Graves leaned on me to build some disk driver software. ("Screw the
hacker. Write some code, already.") And Dave Cleveland gently reminded
me he needed to hookup ten new desktop computers to our lab-wide
network.</p>

<p>I told each of them that the hacker would be gone "RSN." The
ubiquitous statement of software developers everywhere. Real Soon
Now.</p>

<p>On my way over to the astronomy group, I ducked into the switchyard
for a moment&#8212;just long enough to check my monitors. They showed
someone working on the Bevatron computer, manipulating the password
file.</p>

<p>Bizarre. The Bevatron's one of the lab's particle accelerators, and
their programmers all worked at our lab. Only a system manager could
manipulate the password file. I stood<a id="p213" name="p213"></a>
around, watching. Someone was adding several new accounts.</p>

<p>Well, there's one way to find out if this is legit. Call the
Bevatron folks. Chuck McParland answered. "No, I'm the system
manager. Ain't nobody else licensed."</p>

<p>"Uh, oh. Then you've got a problem. Someone's playing God on your
computer."</p>

<p>Chuck typed a few commands and came back to the phone.</p>

<p>"Son of a bitch."</p>

<p>Chuck's Bevatron particle accelerator used magnets the size of
houses to shoot fragments of atoms into thin targets. In the sixties,
its ammunition was protons. Now, fed from a second accelerator, it
zipped heavy ions up to nearly the speed of light.</p>

<p>After smashing these atomic particles into thin foils, physicists
sift through the debris, looking for fragments which may be the
fundamental building blocks of the universe. Physicists waited months
for time on the beamlines; more important, cancer patients waited as
well.</p>

<p>The Bevatron can accelerate helium ions to a fraction of the speed
of light, where they'll acquire about 160 million electron volts of
energy. At this speed, they travel a few inches and then dump most of
their energy.</p>

<p>If you position a cancer tumor at just the right distance beyond
this accelerator, most of the particles' energy goes into the
tumor. The cancer cells absorb this energy, and the tumor's destroyed
without affecting the rest of the person's body. Unlike X-rays, which
irradiate everything in their path, the Bevatron particles deposit the
bulk of their energy at one location. This works especially well on
brain tumors, which are often surgically inoperable.</p>

<p>Chuck's Bevatron computers calculate that "right distance." They
control the accelerator too, so that the correct energy is used.</p>

<p>Get either of these wrong, and you'll kill the wrong cells.</p>

<p>Every few seconds, a burst of ions spills out of the beamline. By
flipping magnets at the right times, Chuck's computers send these to
either a physics experiment or a cancer patient. A bug in the program
is bad news for both.</p>

<p>The hacker wasn't just poking around a computer. He was playing
with someone's brain stem.<a id="p214" name="p214"></a></p>

<p>Did he know? I doubt it. How could he? To him, the Bevatron's
computer was just another plaything&#8212;a system to exploit. Its
programs aren't labeled, "Danger&#8212;medical computer. Do not
tamper."</p>

<p>He wasn't innocently looking for information. Having found a way to
become system manager, he was fooling with the operating system
itself.</p>

<p>Our operating systems are delicate creations. They control how the
computer behaves, how their programs will respond. System managers
delicately tune their operating systems, trying to squeeze every bit
of performance from the computer. Is the program too slow because it's
competing with other tasks? Fix it by changing the operating system's
scheduler. Or maybe there's not enough room for twelve programs at
once. Then alter the way the operating system allocates memory. Screw
up, though, and the computer won't work.</p>

<p>This hacker didn't care if he wrecked someone else's operating
system. He just wanted to introduce a security hole so that he could
reenter whenever he wished. Did he know that he might kill
someone?</p>

<p>Chuck nailed his system shut by changing all the passwords. Another
door slammed in the hacker's face.</p>

<p>But another worry. I'd been chasing someone around the world, yet I
couldn't prevent him from breaking into any computer he wished. My
only defense was to watch him and warn people who were attacked.</p>

<p>Sure, I could still boot him out of my computer, and wash my hands
of the whole mess. My earlier fears seemed unjustified: I now knew
what security holes he exploited, and it didn't look like he'd planted
any time bombs or viruses in my computer.</p>

<p>Kicking him off my machine would only black out the window that I
used to watch him. He'd continue to attack other computers, using
different networks. I didn't have much choice but to let this SOB
wander around until I could catch him.</p>

<p>But try explaining that to the FBI. On Thursday, January 8, my
local FBI agent Fred Wyniken stopped over.</p>

<p>"I'm here only as a representative of the Alexandria, Virginia,
office," Fred said.<a id="p215" name="p215"></a></p>

<p>"I don't understand," I said. "Why isn't the case being handled
from the Oakland office?"</p>

<p>"The FBI's field offices are pretty much independent of one
another," Fred replied. "What one office thinks is important, another
may well ignore." I could sense in which category he thought my case
belonged.</p>

<p>Fred explained that he didn't know the likelihood of prosecution
because he wasn't handling the case. "But I'd say it's pretty
slim. You can't show any monetary loss. There's no obviously
classified data. And your hacker isn't in the States."</p>

<p>"So that's why my local office isn't handling this case?"</p>

<p>"Remember, Cliff, that the FBI only works cases that the Department
of Justice will prosecute. Since no classified information's been
compromised, there's no reason to commit the resources that it'll take
to resolve this."</p>

<p>"But unless you take action, this hacker will keep hammering on our
computers until he pretty much owns them."</p>

<p>"Look. Every month we get a half-dozen calls saying, 'Help!
Someone's breaking into my computer.' Ninety-five percent of them have
no records, no audit trails, and no accounting data."</p>

<p>"Hold on there. I've got records and audit trails. Hell, I've got
every keystroke that this bastard's typed."</p>

<p>"I'm getting to that. In a few cases, and yours is one of them,
there's good documentation. But that's not enough. The damage must be
sufficient to justify our efforts. How much have you lost?
Seventy-five cents?"</p>

<p>Here we go again. Yes, our computing costs were small change. But I
sensed a larger issue, perhaps one of national importance. My local
FBI agent saw only a six-bit accounting error. No wonder I couldn't
get any interest&#8212;let alone support&#8212;from him.</p>

<p>How much longer before someone noticed? Maybe if a classified
military computer were hit? Or a high-tech medical experiment damaged?
What if a patient in a hospital were injured?</p>

<p>Well, I gave him printouts from the past couple of weeks (after
first signing the back of each copy&#8212;something to do with "rules
of evidence") and a floppy disk with the Mitre telephone logs. He'd
send it all to Mike Gibbons at the<a id="p216" name="p216"></a>
Alexandria office. Maybe Mike would find them useful in convincing the
FBI to talk to the German BKA.</p>

<p>Discouraging. The German telephone technicians still didn't have
their warrants, the FBI wasn't responding, and my boss sent me a curt
note asking when I'd write some software to link up a new printer.</p>

<p>Martha wasn't happy either. The hacker wasn't just breaking into
computers. By way of the beeper, he was invading our home.</p>

<p>"Isn't the FBI or the CIA doing something," she asked, "now that
there's foreigners and spies? I mean, aren't they the
G-men&#8212;Truth, Justice, and the American Way?"</p>

<p>"It's the same old bailiwick problem. The CIA says that the FBI
should work it. The FBI doesn't want to touch it."</p>

<p>"Is the Air Force Office of Something or Another doing
anything?"</p>

<p>"Same story. The problem starts in Germany, and someone's got to
call Germany to solve it. The Air Force Office of Special
Investigations can only bang on the FBI's door."</p>

<p>"Then why not punt?" Martha suggested. "Brick up your computer and
let the hacker roam around theirs. Nobody appointed you official
guardian of America's computers."</p>

<p>"Because I want to know what happened. Who's behind it. What
they're searching for. Research." Luis Alvarez's words still rang,
months afterward.</p>

<p>"Then think of a way to solve your problem without the FBI. If they
won't get the Germans to trace a call, then find some other way."</p>

<p>"How? I can't call the German Bundespost and say, 'Trace this
call!' "</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"For one, I wouldn't know who to call. And they wouldn't believe me
if I did."</p>

<p>"Then find some other way to home in on the hacker."</p>

<p>"Yeah, right. Just ask him to tell me his address."</p>

<p>"Don't laugh. It might work."<a id="p217" name="p217"></a></p>

<h3>39</h3>

<p class="first">"The FBI's tossing in the towel."</p>

<p>This was the message Ann Funk of the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations left for me. The day before, I'd called her and she
said that her group was waiting for the FBI to take action. Now this
greeting.</p>

<p>I tried returning Ann's call, but she'd already left Bolling Air
Force Base. Not much else to do but call the FBI.</p>

<p>The raspy voice at the Alexandria FBI office didn't want to waste
time. "Agent Gibbons is not available right now, but I have a message
for you," the guy said officiously. "Your case is closed and you are
to shut things off."</p>

<p>"Huh? Who said that?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but that's the whole message. Agent Gibbons will be
back next week."</p>

<p>"Did Mike say anything more?" After dozens of conversations,
wouldn't he at least tell me in person?</p>

<p>"I told you, that is the entire message."</p>

<p>Great. Pester the FBI for five months. Trace a connection around
the world. Prove that the hacker's breaking into military
computers. Just when I most needed the FBI's help . . . poof.</p>

<p>Ann Funk called back an hour later. "I just heard that the FBI
decided there's insufficient grounds to continue their
investigation."</p>

<p>"Do the break-ins at the Air Force Space Command make any
difference?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That's the Systems Command, Space Division, Cliff. Get it right,
or you'll confuse us." But Space Command sounds neater. Who'd want to
command a system?</p>

<p>"OK, but doesn't the FBI care about them?"</p>

<p>Ann sighed. "According to the FBI, there's no evidence of actual
espionage."</p>

<p>"Did Mike Gibbons say that?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," she said. "I got the word from a duty<a id="p218"
name="p218"></a> officer who said that Mike's been taken off the case
and can't talk about it."</p>

<p>"So who decided?" Mike was the only computer literate FBI agent I'd
spoken to.</p>

<p>"Probably some middle management at the FBI," Ann said. "They can
catch kidnappers easier than computer hackers."</p>

<p>"So how do you feel?" I asked her. "Should we close up shop or try
to catch the bastard?"</p>

<p>"The FBI says to shut down the hacker's access ports."</p>

<p>"That's not what I asked."</p>

<p>"... and to change all your passwords ..."</p>

<p>"I know what the FBI says. What does the Air Force say?"</p>

<p>"Uh, I don't know. We'll talk later on and call you back."</p>

<p>"Well, unless someone tells us to continue, we'll close up shop and
the hacker can play in your computers all he wants. For five months
we've been chasing this spy and not one government agency has
contributed a dime." I hung up angrily.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, my local FBI agent called. Fred Wyniken left
no doubt about their decision. In an official tone of voice, he
informed me that the FBI felt there was no way to extradite this
hacker because of unclassified hacking.</p>

<p>"Cliff, if you can show that some classified material has been
compromised, or that he's done significant damage to systems, then the
FBI will step in. Until that happens, we're not going to move."</p>

<p>"What do you consider damage? If someone rifles my desk drawers and
duplicates the plans for a new integrated circuit, is that damage? Who
do I turn to?"</p>

<p>Fred wouldn't answer. "If you insist on pursuing this case, the FBI
can assist under the domestic police cooperation act. Your lab should
contact the Berkeley District Attorney and open an investigation. If
your local DA will extradite the hacker, then the FBI will assist in
handling the proper paperwork."</p>

<p>"Huh? After five months you're bouncing me back to my local
District Attorney?" I couldn't believe what I was hearing.<a id="p219"
name="p219"></a></p>

<p>"If you choose to go in that way, the FBI will serve as a conduit
between your local police and the German authorities. The LBL police
would be the center of the investigation, and prosecution would be in
Berkeley."</p>

<p>"Fred, you can't be saying that. This guy's broken into thirty
computers around the country, and you're telling me that it's a local,
Berkeley problem?"</p>

<p>"I'm telling you this much," my local G-man continued. "The FBI has
decided to drop the case. If you want to continue, you'd better handle
it though your local police force."</p>

<p>Not an hour later, Steve White called from Tymnet. He'd just
received the following electronic message from the German
Bundespost:</p>

<p>"It is most urgent that the U.S. authorities contact the German
prosecutor or else the Bundespost will no longer cooperate. We cannot
remain hanging, without any official notification. We will not trace
phone lines without the proper warrants. You must arrange for the FBI
to contact the German BKA immediately."</p>

<p>Oh, hell. Spend months building cooperation between agencies, and
the FBI backs out. Just when we need them.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't have much of a choice. We could do what we were told
and close up, toss away five months of tracking, or we could stay open
and risk censure by the FBI.</p>

<p>Closing down would give the hacker freedom to roam our networks
without anyone watching him. Staying open wouldn't lead us to the
hacker, since the Bundespost wouldn't trace unless the FBI gave the
go-ahead. Either way, the hacker wins.</p>

<p>Time to call on my boss. Roy Keith believed the news right away. "I
never did trust the FBI. We've practically solved the case for them,
yet they won't investigate."</p>

<p>"So what do we do?"</p>

<p>"We don't work for the FBI. They can't tell us what to do. We'll
stay open until the Department of Energy tells us to shut down."</p>

<p>"Should I call DOE?"</p>

<p>"Leave that to me. We've put in a hell of a lot of work, and
they're going to hear about it." Roy mumbled a
bit&#8212;it<a id="p220" name="p220"></a> didn't sound like praise for
the FBI&#8212;then stood up and said firmly, "We'll stay open, all
right."</p>

<p>But monitoring the hacker in Berkeley wasn't tracing him in
Germany. We needed the FBI, even if they didn't need us.</p>

<p>What'll the CIA say?</p>

<p>"Hi, it's Cliff. Our Mends at the, uh, 'F' entity have lost
interest."</p>

<p>"Who'd ya talk to?" Teejay asked.</p>

<p>"The entity's local representative and an officer from their East
Coast office." I was learning spookspeak.</p>

<p>"OK. I'll check into it. Hold still till you hear from me."</p>

<p>Two hours later, Teejay called back. "The word is close up
shop. Your contact, Mike, is off the case. His entity is off chasing
pickpockets."</p>

<p>"So what do we do?"</p>

<p>"Just sit still," the spook said. "We can't get involved&#8212; FCI
belongs to Mike's entity. But someone may lean on Mike's entity. Just
wait."</p>

<p>FCI? Federal Cat Inspector? Federation of Carnivorous Iguanas? I
couldn't figure it out. "Uh, Teejay, what's FCI?"</p>

<p>"Shhh. Don't ask questions. Wheels are turning in places you don't
know about."</p>

<p>I called Maggie Morley&#8212;our Scrabble whiz and all-knowing
librarian. Took her three minutes to find the acronym. "FCI means
Foreign Counter-intelligence," she said. "Met any spies lately?"</p>

<p>So the CIA doesn't handle counterintelligence. The FBI doesn't want
to waste time on this one. And the Deutsche Bundespost wants an
official notice from the United States. Whee.</p>

<p>One other agency might be able to help. Zeke Hanson at the National
Security Agency was sympathetic&#8212;he'd watched every step of
progress we'd made, and knew how much we needed the FBI's
support. Could he help out?</p>

<p>"I'd love to help, Cliff, but we're not able to. The NSA listens
rather than talks."</p>

<p>"But isn't this what the National Computer Security Center is for?
To solve computer security problems?"</p>

<p>"You know the answer. No and no. We're trying to secure computers,
not catch hackers."<a id="p221" name="p221"></a></p>

<p>"Can't you call the FBI and at least encourage them?"</p>

<p>"I'll spread the word, but don't hold your breath."</p>

<p>At best, NSA's computer security center tried to set standards and
encourage computer security. They had no interest in serving as a
clearing-house for problems like mine. And they certainly couldn't get
a search warrant. NSA had no connections with the FBI.</p>

<p>Teejay called back in a couple of days. "We made a grandstand
play," the CIA agent said. "Mike's entity is back on track. Tell me if
they give you any more trouble."</p>

<p>"What'd you do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, talked to a couple friends. Nothing much." What kind of
friends does this guy have? To turn the FBI around in two days
. . . who's he talking to?</p>

<p>It didn't take long before Mike Gibbons of the FBI called. He
explained German law to me: hacking into a computer wasn't a big deal
there. As long as you didn't destroy the computer, breaking into a
system wasn't much worse than double parking.</p>

<p>This didn't make sense to me. If German law was this lenient, why
did the Deutsche Bundespost take the case so seriously?</p>

<p>Mike understood my concerns, and at least agreed to keep working on
the case. "You should know, though, that last year a German hacker was
caught in a Colorado computer, but couldn't be prosecuted."</p>

<p>Would the FBI's Legal Attach&#233; get off his butt?</p>

<p>"I'm working on that," Mike said. "Tell your friends at the
Bundespost that they'll hear from us soon."</p>

<p>That evening, we had another chance to catch the guy. While Martha
and I waited in line at the grocery store, my beeper chimed in. I
dropped my copy of the <em>National Enquirer</em> ("Alien Visitors
from Mars!") and dashed to the pay phone, dialing Steve White.</p>

<p>"Our friend's on the line," I told him.</p>

<p>"OK. I'll call Germany."</p>

<p>Quick conversation and a quick trace. The hacker was on for only
five minutes, yet Steve tracked him into DNIC #2624-4511-049136. A
public access dialup line in Hannover, Germany.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Steve White filled me in on the details.<a id="p222"
name="p222"></a> Wolfgang Hoffman, awakened at 3 a.m., started tracing
that line from Frankfurt. But the telephone engineer assigned to the
Hannover exchange had already gone home for the night. Close, but no
cigar.</p>

<p>Wolfgang had one question for us. The University of Bremen was
willing to cooperate in catching this guy, but who's going to pay? The
hacker was wasting the University's money&#8212;hundreds of dollars a
day. Would we be willing to pay for the hacker?</p>

<p>Impossible. My lab's paper-clip budget was squeezed&#8212;no way
would they spring for this. I passed the message back that I'd ask
around.</p>

<p>Steve pointed out that someone would have to pay, or the Bundespost
will just chop the hacker's access. Now that they knew how he's
ripping off the Datex network, the Germans wanted to plug the
holes.</p>

<p>Yet more news arrived from Germany. A couple of nights ago, the
hacker connected into Berkeley for two minutes. Long enough to track
him to the University of Bremen. Bremen, in turn, tracked him back to
Hannover. It seemed like the hacker wasn't just breaking into our
Berkeley laboratory, but snuck into European networks as well.</p>

<p>"Since they had the chance, why didn't the Germans trace him within
Hannover?"</p>

<p>Steve explained the problems in Hannover's telephone
system. "American telephones are computer controlled, so it's pretty
easy to trace them. But they need someone at the exchange to trace the
call in Hannover."</p>

<p>"So we can't trace him unless the hacker calls during the day or
evening?"</p>

<p>"Worse than that. It'll take an hour or two to make the trace once
it's started."</p>

<p>"An hour or two? Are you kidding? Why it takes you ten seconds to
trace Tymnet's lines from California across a satellite and into
Europe. Why can't they do the same?"</p>

<p>"They would if they could. The hacker's telephone exchange just
isn't computerized. So it'll take a while for the technician to trace
it."</p>

<p>Lately, the hacker had been showing up for five minutes at a
time. Long enough to wake me up, but hardly enough<a id="p223"
name="p223"></a> for a two-hour trace. How could I keep him on for a
couple of hours?</p>

<p>The Bundespost couldn't keep technicians on call forever. In fact,
they could hardly afford to keep them around for more than a few
days. We had one week to complete the trace. After next Saturday
evening, the telephone technicians would call it quits.</p>

<p>I couldn't make the hacker show up at a convenient time. And I
couldn't control how long he hung around. He came and went as he
pleased.</p>

<h3>40</h3>

<p class="first">"Wake up, you sloth," said Martha at the obscenely
early hour of nine on a Saturday morning. "Today we prepare the ground
for our tomato plants."</p>

<p>"It's just January," I protested. "Everything is dormant. Bears are
hibernating. I am hibernating." I pulled the covers over my head, only
to have them snatched away. "Come on outside," said Martha, taking a
viselike grip on my wrist.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seemed that I was right. The garden was dead
and brown. "Look," Martha said, kneeling beside a rose bush. She
touched the swelling pink buds. She pointed at the plum tree, and
looking more closely, I saw a mist of tiny green leaves emerging from
the bare branches. Those poor California plants&#8212;without a winter
to sleep through.</p>

<p>Martha gave me a shovel, and we began the yearly cycle; turning
over the soil, adding fertilizer, planting tiny tomato seedlings in
their furrows. Every year we carefully planted several varieties that
took different amounts of time to ripen, and staggered the planting by
several weeks, so we would have a steady supply of tomatoes all
summer. And every year, every single tomato ripened on the fifteenth
of August.</p>

<p>It was slow, heavy work because the soil was dense with clay and
wet from the winter rains. But we finally got the<a id="p224"
name="p224"></a> plot spaded, and, dirty and sweaty, stopped to take a
shower and have brunch.</p>

<p>In the shower, I felt revived. Martha sudsed my back while I basked
in hot water. Maybe the wholesome rustic life wasn't so bad after
all.</p>

<p>Martha was in the midst of shampooing my hair when the nasty whine
of my beeper, buried in a pile of clothing, destroyed our
peace. Martha groaned and started to protest: "Don't you
dare. . . ."</p>

<p>Too late. I jumped out of the shower and ran to the living room,
switched on my Macintosh, and called the lab computer. Sventek.</p>

<p>A second later, I'm talking to Steve White at his home. "He's here,
Steve."</p>

<p>"OK. I'll trace him and call Frankfurt."</p>

<p>A moment later, Steve's back on the line. "He's gone. The hacker
was here a moment ago, but he's disconnected already. No use calling
Germany now."</p>

<p>Damn. I stood there in utter frustration; stark naked, wet and
shivering, standing in a puddle in our dining room, dripping blobs of
shampoo onto my computer's keyboard.</p>

<p>Claudia had been practicing Beethoven, but startled by the sight of
her roommate charging, naked, into the living room, she'd put down her
violin and stared. Then she laughed and played a few bars of a
burlesque tune. I tried to respond with a bump and grind, but was too
obsessed with the hacker to pull it off.</p>

<p>I wandered sheepishly back into the bathroom. Martha glowered at
me, then relented and pulled me into the shower again, under the hot
water.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sweetheart," I apologized. "It's our only chance to
nail him, and he wasn't around long enough to catch."</p>

<p>"Great," Martha said. "Long enough to drag you out of the shower,
but not enough time to find out where he is. Maybe he knows you're
watching him, and he's purposely trying to frustrate you. Somehow, he
telepathically knows when you're in the shower. Or in bed."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sweetheart." I was, too.</p>

<p>"Honey, we've got to do something about this. We can't let this guy
keep yanking us around. And all those spooks<a id="p225"
name="p225"></a> in suits you keep talking to&#8212;what have they
ever done to help? Nothing. We have to take this into our own
hands."</p>

<p>She was right: I'd spent hours on the phone to the FBI, CIA, NSA,
OSI, and the DOE. Still others, like the BKA, knew about our problem,
yet nobody took the initiative.</p>

<p>"But what can we do without the government's help?" I asked. "We
need search warrants and all that. We need official permission to do
phone traces."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but we don't need anyone's permission to put stuff in our
own computer."</p>

<p>So what?</p>

<p>Under the steaming water, Martha turned to me with a sly look.</p>

<p>"Boris? Darlink, I hev a plan . . ." Martha shaped a goatee and
mustache out of soap suds on my face.</p>

<p>"Yes, Natasha?"</p>

<p>"Ees time for ze secret plan 35B."</p>

<p>"Brilliant, Natasha! Zat will vork perfectly! Ah, darlink
. . . vhat is secret plan 35B?"</p>

<p>"Ze Operation Showerhead."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Vell, you see, zee spy from Hannover seeks ze secret information,
yes?" Martha said. "We give him just vhat he vants&#8212;secret
military spy secrets. Lots of zem. Oodles of secrets."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Natasha dahlink, zees secrets, vhere shall ve get them
from? Ve don't know any military secrets."</p>

<p>"Ve make zem up, Boris!"</p>

<p>Yow! Martha had come up with the obvious solution to our
problem. Give the guy what he's looking for. Create some files of
phony information, laced with bogus secret documents. Leave 'em lying
around my computer. The hacker stumbles on them, and then spends a
couple hours lapping it up, copying it all.</p>

<p>Elegant.</p>

<p>How much stuff? As I rinsed Martha's hair, I calculated: we want
him on for two hours. He's connected over a 1200-baud line, which
means he can read about one hundred twenty characters a second. In two
hours, he could scan about one hundred fifty thousand words.</p>

<p>"Oh, Natasha, my charming counter-counter-spy, there's<a id="p226"
name="p226"></a> just vun problem. Where do ve find five hundred pages
of fake secrets?"</p>

<p>"Simple, dollink. Ze secrets, ve invent. Ze regular data, ve use
vhat's already lying around."</p>

<p>As the hot water ran out, we clambered out of the shower. Martha
grinned as she explained further. "We can't invent that much
information overnight. But we can create it as we go along, staying
just ahead of him. And we can take ordinary bureaucratic documents,
modify them a bit, and give them secret-sounding titles. Real secret
documents are probably thick with boring, bureaucratic jargon ..."</p>

<p>". . . So we'll just take a bunch of those unintelligible
Department of Energy directives that are always littering my desk, and
change them to look like state secrets."</p>

<p>Martha continued. "We'll have to be careful to keep it bland and
bureaucratic. If we head a document with 'CHECK OUT THIS TOP SECRET
ULTRA-CLASSIFIED NEAT STUFF,' then the hacker's going to get
suspicious. Keep it all low-key. Forbidden enough to keep him
interested, but not an obvious trap."</p>

<p>I rolled her ideas around my mind and realized how to implement
them. "Sure. We invent this secretary, see, who works for people doing
this secret project. And we let the hacker stumble onto her word
processing files. Lots of rough drafts, repetitive stuff, and
interoffice memos."</p>

<p>Claudia greeted us in the living room, where she had mopped up the
pond I'd left behind. She listened to our plan and suggested a new
wrinkle: "You know, you could create a form letter in your computer
that invites the hacker to write in for more information. If the
hacker fell for it, he might include his return address."</p>

<p>"Right," said Martha, "a letter promising more information, of
course!</p>

<p>The three of us sat around the kitchen table with devious grins,
eating omelets and elaborating on our plan. Claudia described how the
form letter should work: "I think it ought to be like a prize in a
crackerjack box. Write to us, and we'll send you, uh . . . a secret
decoder ring."</p>

<p>"But come on," I said, "there's no way he'll be stupid enough to
send us his address." Seeing that I had thrown cold water on my
coconspirators, I added that it was worth<a id="p227" name="p227"></a>
a try, but the main thing is to give him something that'll take a
couple of hours to chew on.</p>

<p>Then I thought of another problem. "We don't know enough about
military stuff to make sensible documents."</p>

<p>"They don't have to make sense," Martha grinned diabolically. "Real
military documents don't make sense either. They're full of jargon and
double-talk. You know, like 'the procedure for implementing the highly
prioritized implementation procedure is hereinafter described in
section two, subparagraph three of the procedural implementation
plan.' Eh, Boris?"</p>

<p>Well, Martha and I hiked up to the laboratory and logged onto the
LBL computer. There we shoveled through a mound of real government
documents and directives, which were overflowing with far more turgid
bureaucratese than we could ever invent, changing them slightly so
that they'd look 'classified.'</p>

<p>Our documents would describe a new Star Wars project. An outsider
reading them would believe that Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory had just
landed a fat government contract to manage a new computer network. The
SDI Network.</p>

<p>This bogus network apparently linked together scores of classified
computers and extended to military bases around the world. By reading
our files, you'd find lieutenants and colonels, scientists and
engineers. Here and there, we dropped hints of meetings and classified
reports.</p>

<p>And we invented Barbara Sherwin, the sweet, bumbling secretary
trying to figure out her new word processor and to keep track of the
endless stream of documents produced by our newly invented "Strategic
Defense Initiative Network Office." We named our fictitious secretary
after an astronomer, Barbara Schaefer, and used the astronomer's real
mailing address. I mentioned to the real Barbara to watch for any
strange mail addressed to Barb Sherwin.</p>

<p>Our fake memoranda included budget requests ($50 million for
communications costs), purchase orders, and technical descriptions of
this network. We cribbed most of them from files lying around the
computer, changing the addresses and a few words here and there.</p>

<p>For a mailing list, I grabbed a copy of the lab newsletter's list
of names and addresses. I just flipped every "Mr." to<a id="p228"
name="p228"></a> "Lieutenant," every "Mrs." to "Captain," every "Dr."
to "Colonel," and every "Professor" to "General," The addresses? Just
stir in an occasional "Air Force Base" and "Pentagon." In half an
hour, my ersatz mailing list looked like a veritable military Who's
Who.</p>

<p>Some of the documents, however, we fabricated completely:
correspondence between managers and petty bureaucrats. An information
packet describing the technical capabilities of this network. And a
form letter saying that the recipient could get more information on
the SDI Network by writing to the project office.</p>

<p>"Let's label the account, the 'Strategic Information Network
Group,' " I said. "It's got a great acronym: STING."</p>

<p>"Naw. He might catch on. Keep it bureaucratic," Martha said. "Use
SDINET. It'll catch his eye, all right."</p>

<p>We put all the files under one account, SDINET, and made certain
that I was the only one who knew the password. Then I made these files
entirely inaccessible to everyone except the owner&#8212;me.</p>

<p>Large computers let you make a file world-readable, that is, open
to anyone who logs into the system. It's a bit like leaving an office
cabinet unlocked&#8212;anyone can read the contents when they
wish. You might set world-read on a file containing the scores of the
office's volleyball tournament.</p>

<p>With a single command, you can make a file readable by only certain
people&#8212;for example, your co-workers. The latest sales report, or
some manufacturing designs, need to be shared among a few people, but
you don't want everyone to scan them.</p>

<p>Or a computer file can be entirely private. Nobody but you can read
it. Like locking your desk drawer, this keeps everyone out. Well,
almost everyone. The system manager can bypass the file protections,
and read any file.</p>

<p>By setting our SDI files to be readable only by their owner, I made
sure that nobody else would find them. Since I was the owner and the
system manager, nobody else could see them.</p>

<p>Except, perhaps, a hacker masquerading as system manager.</p>

<p>For the hacker could still break in and become system manager. It
would take him a couple of minutes to hatch his<a id="p229"
name="p229"></a> cuckoo's egg, but he'd then be able to read all the
files on my system. Including those bogus SDI files.</p>

<p>If he touched those files, I'd know about it. My monitors saved his
every move. Just to make certain, though, I attached an alarm to those
SDI network files. If anyone looked at them&#8212;or just caused the
computer to try to look at them&#8212;I'd find out about it. Right
away.</p>

<p>My snare was baited. If the hacker bit, he'd take two hours to
swallow the bait. Long enough for the Germans to track him down.</p>

<p>The next move was the hacker's.</p>

<h3>41</h3>

<p class="first">I'd screwed up again. Operation Showerhead was ready,
all right. It might even work. But I'd forgotten an important
detail.</p>

<p>I hadn't asked anyone's permission.</p>

<p>Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, since nobody cared what I did
anyway. But bicycling up to the lab, I realized that every
organization I'd been in contact with would want to know about our
phony SDI files. Each place would have a different opinion, of course,
but to go ahead without telling anyone would piss them all off.</p>

<p>But what if I asked their permission? I didn't want to think about
it. Mostly, I worried about my boss. If Roy stood behind me, then the
three-letter agencies couldn't touch me.</p>

<p>On January 7, I went straight to his office. We talked about
relativistic electrodynamics for a while&#8212;which mostly meant my
watching the old professor at the chalkboard. Say what you will about
crusty college professors, there's no better way to learn than to
listen to someone who's paid his dues.</p>

<p>"Say, boss, I'm trying to get out from under this hacker."</p>

<p>"CIA leaning on you again?"</p>

<p>Roy was joking, I hoped.</p>

<p>"No, but the Germans will only trace the line for one<a id="p230"
name="p230"></a> more week. After next weekend, we might as well call
it quits."</p>

<p>"Good. It's been too long anyway."</p>

<p>"Well, I was thinking about planting some misleading data in our
computer, to use as bait in catching the hacker."</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me. It won't work, of course."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because the hacker's too paranoid. Still, go ahead. It'll be a
useful exercise." Hot damn!</p>

<p>My boss's approval insulated me from the rest of the world. Still,
I ought to tell the three-letter folks about our plans. I wrote a
short proposal, framed as a scientific paper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proposal to Determine the Address of the Hacker</p>

<p><br /> Problem:</p>

<p>A persistent hacker has invaded LBL's computers. Because he is
coming from Europe, it takes an hour to trace the phone lines. We
would like to learn his exact location.</p>

<p><br /> Observations:</p>

<p>1. He is persistent.</p>

<p>2. He confidently works within our computers, unaware that we are
watching him.</p>

<p>3. He searches for phrases like "sdi," "stealth," and
"nuclear."</p>

<p>4. He is a competent programmer and is experienced at breaking into
networks.</p>

<p><br /> Suggested solution:</p>

<p>Provide fictitious information to keep him connected for more than
an hour. Complete the phone trace during this time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My paper went on and on about History, Methodology, Implementation
Details, and had footnotes about the chances of actually catching
him. As boring as I could make it.</p>

<p>I sent this paper to the usual list of three-letter agencies: the
FBI, CIA, NSA, and DOE. I included a note saying that unless someone
objected, we'd carry out this plan next week.</p>

<p>A few days later, I called each agency. Mike Gibbons of the FBI
understood what I was getting at, but wouldn't commit his agency one
way or another. "What does the CIA have to say about it?"<a id="p231"
name="p231"></a></p>

<p>Teejay at the CIA had also read my proposal, but was equally
noncommittal:</p>

<p>"What did the guys at the 'F' entity say?"</p>

<p>"Mike said to call you."</p>

<p>"Well, ain't that dandy. Have you called the northern entity?"
Northern entity? What's north of the CIA?</p>

<p>"Uh, Teejay, who's the northern entity?"</p>

<p>"You know, the big Fort M."</p>

<p>Oh&#8212;Fort Meade in Maryland. The NSA.</p>

<p>Yes, I had called Fort Meade, and Zeke Hanson at the NSA's National
Computer Security Center had read my proposal. He seemed to like it,
but he didn't want to have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>"Well, I sure can't tell you to go ahead," Zeke said. "Personally,
I'd love to see what happens. But if you get into trouble, we don't
have anything to do with it."</p>

<p>"I'm not looking for someone to take responsibility. I'm wondering
if it's a bad idea." Sounds strange, but that's just what I was trying
to do. Before you start an experiment, get the opinions of people
who've been there before.</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me. But you really ought to check with the FBI."
That closed the circle&#8212;everyone pointed their finger at someone
else.</p>

<p>Well, I called the Department of Energy, the Air Force OSI, and a
guy at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Nobody would take
responsibility, of course, yet nobody blocked the idea. That's all I
needed.</p>

<p>By Wednesday, it was too late for anyone to object. I was sold on
Martha's idea, and was willing to back it up.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Wednesday afternoon, the hacker showed up. I'd been
invited to lunch at the Cafe Pastorale in Berkeley with Dianne
Johnson, the field representative of the Department of Energy. Along
with Dave Stevens, the computer center's math whiz, we enjoyed some
fine fettuccini, while talking about our progress and plans.</p>

<p>At 12:53 PST, in the middle of a cup of cappuccino, my beeper went
off. The Morse code said the hacker was into our Unix-4 computer as
Sventek. I didn't say a word&#8212;just ran to the phone booth and
called Steve White at Tymnet ($2.25 in quarters), and he started the
trace running. The<a id="p232" name="p232"></a> hacker was on for only
three minutes&#8212;just long enough to see who was logged onto my
computer. I was back at the table before the coffee cooled off.</p>

<p>That spoiled the rest of lunch for me. Why had he stayed around
only three minutes? Did he sense a trap? I couldn't tell until I saw
the printout up at the lab.</p>

<p>The monitors showed him logging on as Sventek, listing the names of
everyone currently logged on, and then disappearing. Damn him. He
didn't look around long enough to discover our bogus files.</p>

<p>Oh&#8212;maybe our bait was too well hidden. The German phone
technician would be around for only a couple more days, so I'd better
make it more obvious.</p>

<p>From now on, I'd stay logged on to my computer. I would play sweet
Barbara Sherwin, connected to the computer on the SDINET account. The
next time the hacker raised his periscope, he'd see SDINET clunking
away, trying to edit some file or another. If that didn't catch his
attention, then nothing would.</p>

<p>Naturally, he didn't show up the next day, Thursday. We were
running out of time. Nothing the next morning. I was about to call it
quits, when my beeper sounded at 5:14 p.m, Friday, January 16. There's
the hacker.</p>

<p>And I'm here, working in the SDINET account, playing with a word
processing program. His first command, "who," listed ten people. I was
the seventh on his list:</p>

<pre>
<u>who</u> Astro Carter Fermi Meyers Microprobe Oppy5 Sdinet Sventek
Turnchek Tompkins
</pre>

<p>There's the bait. Come on, go for it! <a id="p233"
name="p233"></a></p>

<pre>
lbl&gt; <u>grep sdinet/etc/passwd</u> <span class="comment">He's
searching for user "SDINET"</span>
                               <span class="comment">in our password
file</span> Sdln8t:sx4sd34x2:user sdinet, files in/u4/sdinet, owner
sdi network project
</pre>

<p>Ha! He swallowed the hook! He's hunting for information about the
user SDINET! I knew what he'd do next&#8212; he'd search over in the
SDINET directory.</p>

<pre>
lbl&gt; <u>cd/u4/sdinet</u> <span class="comment">He's moving over to
the SDINET directory</span>
lbl&gt; <u>ls</u> <span class="comment">and trying to list the file
names</span> file protection violation&#8212;you are not the
owner. <span class="comment">But he can't see them!</span>
</pre>

<p>Of course he can't read the SDINET data&#8212;I've locked everyone
out of those files. But he knows how to evade my lock. Just plant a
little egg, using the Gnu-Emacs software. Become super-user.</p>

<p>None of my files are hidden from the system manager. And my visitor
knows exactly how to grab those privileges. It just takes a few
minutes. Would he reach into the monkey bottle?</p>

<p>There he goes. He's checking that the Gnu-Emacs move-mail program
hasn't been changed. Now he's creating his own false atrun
program. Just like the old days. In a couple more minutes, he'll be
system manager.</p>

<p>Only this time, I'm on the phone to Steve White.</p>

<p>"Steve, call Germany. The hacker's on, and it'll be a long
session."</p>

<p>"Spot-on, Cliff. Call you back in ten minutes."</p>

<p>Now it's the Germans' turn. Can they pull the plum from the pie?
Let's see, it's 5:15 p.m. in Berkeley, so in Germany, it's uh, 2:15 in
the morning. Or is it 1:15? Either way, it's sure not ordinary
business hours. Sure hope that the Hannover technicians stayed late
tonight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the hacker's not wasting time. Within five minutes, he'd
built a special program to make himself super-user. He twisted the
tail of the Gnu-Emacs program, moving his special program into the
systems area. Any minute now, Unix will discover that program and
. . . yep, there it goes. He's super-user.<a id="p234"
name="p234"></a></p>

<p>The hacker went straight for the forbidden SDINET files. (I'm glued
to my monitor, thinking, "Come on, guy, wait till you see what's
sitting there for you.") Sure enough, he first lists the file
names:</p>

<pre>
lbl&gt; <u>ls</u> Connections Form-Letter Funding Mailing-Labels
Pentagon-Request Purchase-Orders Memo-to-Gordon Rhodes-Letter
SDI-computers SDI-networks SDI-Network-Proposal User-List
World-Wide-Net Visitor-information
</pre>

<p>Many of these files aren't just single memos. Some are file
directories&#8212;whole file cabinets full of other files.</p>

<p>Which one will he look at first? That's easy. All of them.</p>

<p>For the next forty-five minutes, he dumps out file after file,
reading all the garbage that Martha and I created. Boring, tedious
ore, with an occasional nugget of technical information. For
example:</p>

<pre>
Dear Major Rhodes: Thank you for your comments concerning access to
  SDINET. As you know, a Network User Identifier (NUI) is required for
  access to both the Classified and Unclassified SDINET. Although
  these NUI's are distributed from different locations, it is
  important that users who use both sections of the network retain the
  same NUI.  For this reason, your command center should contact the
  network controllers directly. At our laboratory In Berkeley, we can
  easily modify your NUI, but we would prefer that you issue the
  appropriate request to the network controllers.  Sincerely yours.
  Barbara Sherwin<a id="p235" name="p235"></a>
</pre>

<p>Aah . . . there's a pointer in that letter saying that you can
reach the SDINET from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. I'll bet that
he'll spend an hour or two searching for the portal to reach that
mythical SDINET.</p>

<p>Did he believe what I'd fed him? There's an easy way to find
out. Just watch what he does&#8212;a disbeliever won't go hunting for
the Holy Grail.</p>

<p>The files made a believer out of him. He interrupted his listing to
search for a connection into our SDI network. On my monitor, I watched
him patiently scan all our links to the outside world. Without knowing
our system thoroughly, he couldn't search exhaustively, but he spent
ten minutes checking the system for any ports labeled "SDI."</p>

<p>Hook, line, and sinker.</p>

<p>He returned to reading our fake SDINET files, and dumped the file
named form-letter:</p>

<p>I wondered how he'd react to this letter. Would he send us his
address?</p>

<p>It didn't make much difference. Steve White called back from
Tymnet. "I've traced your connection over to the University of
Bremen."</p>

<p>"Same as usual, huh?"<a id="p237" name="p237"></a></p>

<p>"Yeah. I guess they've reopened for classes," Steve said. "At any
rate, the Bundespost has traced the Datex line from Bremen into
Hannover."</p>

<p>"OK. Sounds like the hacker's in Hannover."</p>

<p>"That's what the Bundespost says. They've traced the Datex line
into a dial-in port located near downtown Hannover."</p>

<p>"Keep going, I follow you."</p>

<p>"Now comes the tough part. Someone has dialed into the Datex system
in Hannover. They're coming from Hannover, all right&#8212;it's not a
long-distance line."</p>

<p>"Does the Bundespost know that phone number?"</p>

<p>"Almost. In the past half hour, the technician traced the line and
has narrowed it down to one of fifty telephone numbers."</p>

<p>"Why can't they get the actual number?"</p>

<p>"Wolfgang's unclear about that. It sounds like they've determined
the number to be from a group of local phones, but the next time they
make a trace, they'll zero in on the actual telephone. From the sound
of Wolfgang's message, they're excited about solving this case."</p>

<p>One in fifty, huh? The Bundespost is almost there. Next time,
they'll have him.</p>

<p>Friday, January 16, 1987. The cuckoo laid its eggs in the wrong
nest.</p>

<h3>42</h3>

<p class="first">The trace almost reached the hacker. If he came by
once more, we'd have him.</p>

<p>But the deadline was tomorrow night. Saturday, when the German
telephone technicians would give up the chase. Would he show up?</p>

<p>"Martha, you don't want to hear this, but I'm sleeping at the lab
again. This may be the end of the road, though."</p>

<p>"That's the dozenth time you've said that."</p>

<p>Probably was. The chase had been a constant stream of "I've almost
got him" followed by "He's somewhere else."<a id="p238"
name="p238"></a> But this time it felt different. The messages from
Germany were confident. They were on the right scent.</p>

<p>The hacker hadn't read all our bogus files. In the forty-five
minutes that he'd linked into our system, he listed about a third of
the data. He knew there was more, so why didn't he stay around and
browse?</p>

<p>All the more likely that he'd come back soon. So once again, I
crawled under my desk and fell asleep to the sound of a computer disk
drive whining in the distance.</p>

<p>I woke up, for once, without a beeper squawking in my ear. Just a
peaceful Saturday morning, alone in a sterile office, staring at the
bottom of my desk. Oh well, I'd tried. Too bad the hacker didn't show
up.</p>

<p>Since nobody else was around, I started to play with an
astronomical program, trying to understand how mistakes in
mirror-grinding affect images from a telescope. The program was just
about working when my beeper called at 8:08 a.m.</p>

<p>A quick jog down the hall, and a glance at the monitor's
screen. There's the hacker, just logging into the Unix-5 computer, on
one of his old account names, Mark. No time to figure what he's doing
here, just spread the word fast. Call Tymnet, and let them call the
Bundespost.</p>

<p>"Hi Steve!"</p>

<p>"The hacker's back on, eh?" Steve must have heard it in the tone of
my voice.</p>

<p>"Yep. Can you start the trace?"</p>

<p>"Here goes." He was gone for thirty seconds&#8212;it couldn't have
been a full minute&#8212;when he announced, "He's coming from Bremen
this time."</p>

<p>"Same as yesterday," I observed.</p>

<p>"I'll tell Wolfgang at the Bundespost." Steve hung up while I
watched the hacker on my screen. Every minute the hacker visited, we
were that much closer to unmasking him.</p>

<p>Yes, there he was, methodically reading our false data files. With
every bureaucratic memo he read, I felt more satisfied, knowing he was
being misled in two ways: his information was patently false, and his
arrogant strides through our computer were leading him straight into
our arms.<a id="p239" name="p239"></a></p>

<p>At 8:40, he left our computer. Steve White called back within a
minute.</p>

<p>"The Germans traced him through the University of Bremen again," he
said. "From there, into Hannover."</p>

<p>"Did they make any progress in getting his phone number?"</p>

<p>"Wolfgang says they've got all the digits of his phone number
except the last two."</p>

<p>All but the last two digits? That didn't make sense&#8212;it meant
that they'd traced the call to a group of one hundred phones. "But
that's worse than yesterday, when they said they'd isolated him to one
of fifty phones."</p>

<p>"All I can tell you is what I hear."</p>

<p>Disturbing, but at least they were tracing the lines.</p>

<p>At 10:17, he came back. By now, Martha had bicycled up to the lab,
and the two of us were busy inventing new SDI files to feed him. We
both ran to the monitors and watched him, expecting him to discover
our latest work.</p>

<p>This time, he wasn't interested in SDI files. Instead, he went out
over the Milnet, trying to break into military computers. One by one,
trying to guess his way past their password protection.</p>

<p>He concentrated on Air Force and Army computers, occasionally
knocking on the Navy's door. Places I'd never heard of, like the Air
Force Weapons Lab, Descom Headquarters, Air Force CC OIS, the
CCA-amc. Fifty places, without success.</p>

<p>Then he slid across the Milnet into a computer named Buckner. He
got right in ... didn't even need a password on the account named
"guest."</p>

<p>Martha and I looked at each other, then at the screen. He'd broken
into the Army Communications Center in Building 23, Room 121, of Fort
Buckner. That much was obvious: the computer greeted the hacker with
its address. But where's Fort Buckner?</p>

<p>About all I could tell was that its calendar was wrong. It said
today was Sunday, and I knew it was Saturday. Martha took charge of
the monitors, and I ran to the library, returning with their now
familiar atlas.</p>

<p>Paging through the back pages, I found Ft. Buckner listed.</p>

<p>"Hey, Martha, you're not going to believe this, but the<a id="p240"
name="p240"></a> hacker's broken into a computer in Japan. Here's your
Fort Buckner," I said, pointing to an island in the Pacific
Ocean. "It's on Okinawa."</p>

<p>What a connection! From Hannover, Germany, the hacker linked to the
University of Bremen, across a transatlantic cable into Tymnet, then
into my Berkeley computer, and into the Milnet, finally reaching
Okinawa. Jeez.</p>

<p>If someone in Okinawa had detected him, they'd have to unravel a
truly daunting maze.</p>

<p>Not that this worldwide link satisfied him&#8212;he wanted Fort
Buckner's database. For half an hour, he probed their system, finding
it amazingly barren. A few letters here and there, and a list of about
seventy-five users. Fort Buckner must be a very trusting place: nobody
set passwords on their accounts.</p>

<p>He didn't find much on that system, outside of some electronic mail
messages talking about when supplies would arrive from Hawaii. A
collector of military acronyms would love the Fort Buckner computer,
but any sane person would be bored.</p>

<p>"If he's so interested in military gobbledegook," Martha asked,
"why not enlist?"</p>

<p>Well, this hacker wasn't bored. He listed as many text files as he
could, skipping only the programs and Unix utilities. A bit after
eleven in the morning, he finally grew tired, and logged off.</p>

<p>While he'd circled the globe with his spiderweb of connections, the
German Bundespost had homed in on him.</p>

<p>The phone rang&#8212;had to be Steve White.</p>

<p>"Hi, Cliff," Steve said. "The trace is complete."</p>

<p>"The Germans got the guy?"</p>

<p>"They know his phone number."</p>

<p>"Well, who is he?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They can't say right now, but you're supposed to tell the
FBI."</p>

<p>"Just tell me this much," I told Steve, "is it a computer or a
person?"</p>

<p>"A person with a computer at his home. Or should I say, at his
business."</p>

<p>Martha overheard the conversation and was now<a id="p241"
name="p241"></a> whistling a tune from the Wizard of Oz: "Ding-dong,
the witch is dead. . . ."</p>

<p>At last, the trace was over. The police would bust him, he'd be
arraigned, we'd press charges, and he'd be pacing a jail cell. So I
thought.</p>

<p>But more important, my research was finished. Five months ago, I
asked myself, "How come my accounts are unbalanced by 75 cents?" That
question had led me across the country, under the ocean, through
defense contractors and universities, to Hannover, Germany.</p>

<p>Martha and I biked home, stopping only to pick up a pint of heavy
cream. We picked the last of our garden's strawberries and celebrated
with homemade milkshakes. No doubt&#8212;there's no substitute for
mixing 'em yourself. Toss in some ice cream, a couple bananas, a cup
of milk, two eggs, a couple spoonfuls of vanilla, and a handful of
home-grown strawberries. Thicken it with just enough malt. Now that's
a milkshake.</p>

<p>Claudia, Martha, and I danced around the yard for a while&#8212;our
plans had worked out perfectly.</p>

<p>"In a couple days, the police will bust him, and we'll find out
what he was after," I told them. "Now that someone knows who's behind
this, it can't be long."</p>

<p>"Yow, you'll get your name in the newspaper," Claudia
marveled. "Will you still talk to us?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll even keep washing the dishes."</p>

<p>The rest of the day, Martha and I spent in San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park, riding the merry-go-round and roller-skating.</p>

<p>After all these months, the problem was solved. We'd thrown a net
around the cuckoo.</p>

<h3>43</h3>

<p class="first">He stared bleakly at the broken greasy Venetian
blinds, a cigarette butt dangling from his clammy lips. The sickly
green glow of the screen reflected on his sallow tired
features. Silently, deliberately, he invaded the computer.<a id="p242"
name="p242"></a></p>

<p>Six thousand miles away, her longing white arms craved for him. He
could feel her hot breath on his cheek, as her delicate fingers curled
through his long brown hair. Her negligee parted invitingly, he sensed
every curve through the thin silken gauze. She whispered, "Darling,
don't leave me. . . ."</p>

<p>Suddenly the night was shattered&#8212;that sound again&#8212;he
froze and stared at the night stand. A red light beckoned across the
pitch-black room. His beeper sang its siren song.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, at 6:30, Martha and I were dreaming when the hacker
stepped on my electronic tripwire. Damn. Such a great dream, too.</p>

<p>I slid out from under the quilts and called Steve White. He passed
the message along to the Bundespost, and five minutes later, the trace
was complete. Hannover again. Same guy.</p>

<p>From home, I couldn't observe him&#8212;he might notice me watching
him. But only yesterday he'd finished reading all our phony SDI
files. So why come back now?</p>

<p>It wasn't until I biked into work that I saw the hacker's
targets. Milnet again. The printout showed him logging into my
Berkeley computer, then reaching out over the Milnet, then trying to
log onto a system at the Eglin Air Force Base.</p>

<p>He tried account names like guest, system, manager, and field
service ... all his old tricks. Eglin's computer didn't put up with
such nonsense: it kicked him out after his fourth try. So, he went on
the European Milnet Control computer, and tried again. Still no
luck.</p>

<p>Sixty computers later, he still hadn't gotten into a military
computer. But he kept trying.</p>

<p>At 1:39 p.m., he succeeded in logging into the Navy Coastal Systems
Center in Panama City, Florida. He got into their system by trying the
account "Ingres" with the password "Ingres."</p>

<p>Ingres database software lets you quickly search thousands of
accounting records for the one entry you need. You make queries like,
"Tell me all the quasars that emit X-rays," or "How many Tomahawk
missiles are deployed in the Atlantic fleet?" Database software is
powerful stuff, and the Ingres system is among the finest.<a id="p243"
name="p243"></a></p>

<p>But it's sold with a backdoor password. When you install Ingres, it
comes with a ready-made account that has an easily guessed
password. My hacker knew this. The Navy Coastal Systems Center
didn't.</p>

<p>Once logged on, he meticulously checked that nobody was watching
him. He listed the file structures and searched for links to nearby
networks. He then listed the entire encrypted password file.</p>

<p>There he goes again. That's the third or fourth time I'd seen him
copy the whole password file into his home machine. Something's
strange here&#8212;the passwords are protected by encryption, so he
can't possibly figure out the original password. Still, why else would
he copy the password file?</p>

<p>After an hour inside the navy computer, he grew tired and went back
to knocking on doors along the Milnet. That, too, lost its excitement
after a while; after fifty or a hundred times, even he tired of seeing
the message, "Invalid Login&#8212; bad password." So he printed out
some SDINET files again, pretty much the same stuff he'd seen in the
past couple of days. Around 2:30 in the afternoon he called it
quits. He'd spent eight hours hacking on the military networks.</p>

<p>Plenty of time to trace his call. And time enough to learn that the
German Bundespost has been in close contact with the Public Prosecutor
in Bremen, Germany. They're contacting the authorities in Hannover,
and they're also talking to the German BKA. Sounds like someone is
about ready to close in on the hacker and make the arrest.</p>

<p>Who should I call about this break-in into the Navy computer?</p>

<p>A week ago, the Air Force OSI warned me not to call the system
managers directly. Jim Christy said, "It's just runs against military
policy."</p>

<p>"I understand," I said. "But is there a clearinghouse to report
these problems to?"</p>

<p>"No, not really," Jim explained. "You can tell the National
Computer Security Center, but they're pretty much a one-way trap. They
listen, all right, but they don't publicize problems. So if it's a
military computer, call us," Jim said. "We'll go through channels and
get the word to the right folks."<a id="p244" name="p244"></a></p>

<p>Monday morning brought the hacker again. Time to twist some more
doorknobs. One by one, he scanned Milnet computers, ranging from the
Rome Air Development Center in New York to someplace called the Naval
Electronic Warfare Center. He tried fifteen places before he struck
pay dirt&#8212;the Ramstein Air Force Base computer. This time, he
discovered that the account, "bbncc," wasn't protected. No password
needed.</p>

<p>Ramstein's computer seemed to be an electronic mail system for
officers. He started listing everyone's mail. Quickly, it opened my
eyes&#8212;this was stuff that he shouldn't be seeing.</p>

<p>OK, what should I do? I couldn't let him grab this information, yet
I didn't want to tip my hand. Disconnecting him won't do much
good&#8212;he'll just find another pathway. I can't call the
place&#8212;I've no idea where Ramstein Air Force Base is. I can call
Air Force OSI, but I've got to take action now&#8212;not in five
minutes&#8212;before he reads the rest of their data.</p>

<p>I reached for the phone to call Jim Christy of the Air Force
OSI. Naturally I can't remember his phone number. There in my pocket
is a key chain. Of course, the old key chain trick. Just add some
noise to his connection.</p>

<p>I jangled my keys against the connector, shorting out the hacker's
communications line. Just enough to appear as noise to the
hacker. "Static on the line," he'd think. Every time he asked for
electronic mail from Ramstein, I garbled his commands, and Ramstein's
computer misunderstood him.</p>

<p>After a few more attempts, he gave up on Ramstein Air Force Base,
and went back to scanning the Milnet, trying to get into other
places.</p>

<p>I finally reached Jim Christy at Air Force OSI. "The hacker's
gotten into someplace called Ramstein Air Force Base. Wherever it is,
you'd better tell them to change all their passwords."</p>

<p>"Ramstein's in Germany."</p>

<p>"Huh?" I asked. I'd thought the occupation of Europe had ended in
the '50s. "What's the U.S. Air Force doing in Germany?"</p>

<p>"Protecting you. But let's not go into that. I'll warn them right
away. Go back to watching the hacker."<a id="p245"
name="p245"></a></p>

<p>I'd missed ten minutes of the hacker. He was trying to break into
more military systems, slowly and methodically trying dozens of
sites.</p>

<p>The Milnet addresses seemed to be in alphabetical order; right now
he was working near the end of the alphabet. Mostly R's and S's. Aha!
Yes, that was it. He was working from an alphabetized list. Somehow,
he'd obtained the Milnet directory, and was checking off each site
after he tried it.</p>

<p>He'd made it halfway through the S's when he tried a computer
called Seckenheim. Logged right in as "Guest." No password. This was
getting embarrassing.</p>

<p>But though he got into that computer, he didn't stay long. A few
minutes to make a couple scans of their system files, then he logged
off. I wondered why.</p>

<p>Still, I'd better do something. Time to call the Air Force.</p>

<p>"Hey, the hacker just got into someplace called Seckenheim. It's on
the Milnet, so it must be a military computer. But I've never heard of
it."</p>

<p>"Snake in the grass," Jim growled.</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Damn. Seckenheim is the Army Material Command in Europe. Near
Heidelberg. Germany again."</p>

<p>"Oops. Sorry about that."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of it." The hacker's success meant problems for the
narcs. I wondered how many overseas military bases the United States
has. The technology I could handle. It was geography and bureaucracies
that tripped me up.</p>

<p>After having cracked three computers today, the hacker was still
not satisfied. He continued to bang away on the Milnet, so I kept
watch in the switchyard. One by one, I watched as he tried
passwords. At 11:37, he got into a Vax computer named Stewart. Logged
right in there as "Field," password, "Service." I'd seen it
before. Another Vax computer running VMS that hadn't changed their
default passwords.</p>

<p>The hacker dived right in. The field service account was
privileged, and he wasted no time taking advantage of this. He first
disabled accounting, so that he'd leave no tracks behind. Then he went
directly to the <em>authorize</em> utility&#8212;the system software
in charge of passwords&#8212;and selected one user, Rita, who hadn't
used the system for the past few<a id="p246" name="p246"></a>
months. He modified Rita's account to give it full system
privileges. Then he set a new password. "Ulfmerbold."</p>

<p>Where had I heard that word? Ulfmerbold. It sounded
German. Something to figure out later. Meanwhile, I've got to watch my
hacker.</p>

<p>Finally, a bit after noon, the hacker left Berkeley. A productive
day for him.</p>

<p>The Stewart computer turned out to belong to Fort Stew-art, an Army
base in Georgia. I called Mike Gibbons of the FBI, and he took care of
calling them.</p>

<p>"Mike, have you ever heard of the word 'Ulfmerbold'?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Sounds German, though."</p>

<p>"Just checking. Say, the Germans have completed the trace. The
Bundespost now knows who's making the calls."</p>

<p>"Did they tell you?"</p>

<p>"Naw. Nobody ever tells me anything. You know that."</p>

<p>Mike laughed. "That's the way we operate, all right. But I'll get
the Legat on the case right away."</p>

<p>"Legat?"</p>

<p>"Oh. Legal Attach&#233;. You know, the guy in Bonn that handles our
affairs."</p>

<p>"How soon until they arrest the guy?" I just wanted to know who and
why&#8212;the last pieces of the puzzle.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But when it happens, I'll tell you. Shouldn't be
long now."</p>

<p>By chance, around 3 P.M. Teejay called from the CIA. "What's
new?"</p>

<p>"We completed the trace over the weekend."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In Hannover."</p>

<p>"Mmmm. Know the guy's name?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet."</p>

<p>"Does the 'F' entity know?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. But call them and find out. They never tell me a
thing." I doubted that the FBI would tell the CIA, and I didn't want
to be squeezed between the two. It was weird enough to talk to
either.</p>

<p>"Any clues to his identity?"</p>

<p>"Hard to say. Ever hear of the word Ulfmerbold?"</p>

<p>"Mmmm. What's that from?"</p>

<p>"The hacker chose that as a password when he broke<a id="p247"
name="p247"></a> into a computer this morning. At Fort Stewart,
Georgia."</p>

<p>"He's not letting the grass grow, huh?" Teejay still tried to sound
uninterested, but his voice had a tremor that gave it away.</p>

<p>"Yeah. He got into a couple other places too."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "no place special. Just a couple military bases in
Germany. And a place called Fort Buckner."</p>

<p>"Son of a bitch."</p>

<p>"You know them?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. I used to work at Fort Buckner. Back in my Army days. Lived
on base with my wife." A CIA agent with a wife? I'd never thought of
it. Spy novels never mention spouses or kids.</p>

<p>The hacker had chosen a strange password for his
use. Ulfmerbold. Nothing in my dictionary. Not in Cassell's
German-English dictionary. The trusty atlas showed nothing. Yet I'd
heard this word before.</p>

<p>Martha hadn't heard of it. Nor had any of my friends. Not even my
sister, the one who'd risked her life prowling around a high school in
McLean, Virginia.</p>

<p>It took three days, but my boss, Roy Kerth, figured it out. Ulf
Merbold is the West German astronaut who'd made astronomical
observations from the space shuttle.</p>

<p>Another clue to Germany, unnecessary, now that the evidence was
overwhelming. But why pick an astronaut's name? Hero worship? Or some
more sinister motive?</p>

<p>Could this explain why he kept breaking into computers? Could I
have been following someone obsessed with the U.S. space
program&#8212;a guy who dreamed about becoming an astronaut and
collected information about the space program?</p>

<p>Nope. This hacker sought out military computers&#8212;not NASA
systems. He wanted SDI data, not astronomy. You don't search for the
space shuttle on Okinawa. You don't find an astronaut's biography by
looking up the Army's nuclear warfare plans for Central
Europe.<a id="p248" name="p248"></a></p>

<h3>44</h3>

<p class="first">Tuesday morning greeted me with a pile of messages
from Tymnet. Steve White read some electronic mail from the Deutsche
Bundespost. "Since the University of Bremen won't pay for any more
international calls, you'll have to carry that cost."</p>

<p>He knew that we couldn't afford it. "Steve, my boss balks at paying
my salary, let alone this hacker's connections."</p>

<p>"How much time are you putting in on this chase?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about ten hours a day." I wasn't kidding. Even a five-minute
connection by the hacker ballooned into a morning of phone
calls. Everyone wanted to hear what had happened. Nobody offered
support.</p>

<p>"Well then, I've some good news for you," Steve said. "Wolfgang
Hoffman says there's a meeting in Hannover tomorrow. Something about
coordinating legal, technical, and law-enforcement activities."</p>

<p>"Why's that good news?"</p>

<p>"Because they expect to make an arrest this weekend."</p>

<p>Finally.</p>

<p>"But there's a couple problems. The Germans haven't heard from the
FBI yet. So they're putting things on hold. Wolfgang asks that you
pass this message to the FBI."</p>

<p>"Will do."</p>

<p>My next call to the FBI showed the flip side of the coin. Special
Agent Mike Gibbons explained the situation.</p>

<p>He'd sent telegrams to Bonn telling the FBI's Legat to contact the
German police. At the same time, he shipped by air a folder of
information to the Attached But somewhere, the messages weren't
getting through&#8212; Wolfgang still hadn't heard about any warrants
from the FBI.</p>

<p>"You see, we can't talk to anyone except through our Legat," Mike
said. "Still, I'll rattle the cage again, and see that they're awake
in Bonn."</p>

<p>Well, that FBI agent sure wasn't dragging his heels. I never did
find out much about the Legal Attach&#233;&#8212;do they<a id="p249"
name="p249"></a> work for the FBI or the State Department? Is it one
part-time person or a whole staff? What do they really do? Who do they
talk to in the German government? What do you have to do to wake them
up?</p>

<p>The CIA wouldn't leave me alone. Teejay wanted every detail about
the past weekend. But the juicy stuff&#8212;the guy's name, his
motives, and his backers&#8212;remained a mystery. AH I knew was that
he'd been fingered.</p>

<p>"Say, Teejay, if I find out some of this for you, is there any
chance you might, uh, trade some gossip?"</p>

<p>"I don't copy," the spook said.</p>

<p>"I mean, suppose you figure out who was behind all this. What'll
you tell me about it?" I really wanted to know if he could send some
spy over there and find out what this clown was up to.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Cliff. We're listeners, not talkers."</p>

<p>So much for learning anything from the CIA.</p>

<p>Within a day, however, more news came by way of Tymnet. Having
traced the hacker's phone number, they compared his name to that on
the German Datex accounts.</p>

<p>Hmmm. They're doing their homework!</p>

<p>Seems that the hacker used three different identifiers when he
manipulated the Datex network. The first identifier belonged to the
hacker. Same name, same address. The second one belonged to another
person. And the third . . . well, it belonged to a company. A small
company in Hannover that specialized in computers.</p>

<p>Were these identifiers stolen? It's as easy to steal a network user
identifier as it is to steal a telephone credit card number&#8212;just
watch over someone's shoulder as she makes a call. Perhaps the hacker
has ripped off several people's Datex network account numbers. If they
worked for big multinational firms, they might never notice.</p>

<p>Or was this guy in collusion with someone else?</p>

<p>I'd pretty much convinced myself that he was acting alone. If a
couple people were working together, they'd have to constantly
exchange passwords. Moreover, the hacker had a single
personality&#8212;patient, methodical, an almost mechanical
diligence. Someone else wouldn't have quite the same style when
prowling around the Milnet.</p>

<p>A few of his targets weren't sleeping. The day after he<a id="p250"
name="p250"></a> tried to pry their doors open, two of them called
me. Grant Kerr, of the Hill Air Force Base in Utah, phoned. He was
annoyed that one of my users, Sventek, had tried to break into his
computer over the past weekend. And Chris McDonald of White Sands
Missile Range reported the same.</p>

<p>Super! Some of our military bases keep their eyes open. Thirty-nine
in forty are asleep. But there are a few system managers who
vigilantly analyze their audit trails.</p>

<p>For the next few days, the hacker kept me hopping. He kept scanning
my SDINET files, so every few hours, I'd add a couple more. I wanted
the files to reflect an active office&#8212;a backlog of work and a
busy, chatty secretary who didn't quite know how her computer
worked. Pretty soon, I was wasting an hour a day generating this
flimflam, just feeding the hacker.</p>

<p>Zeke Hanson of the National Computer Security Center helped with
these bogus files. I knew nothing about military ranks, so he gave me
a few hints.</p>

<p>"The military's just like any other hierarchy. Up at the top,
there's the flag officers. Generals. Below them are colonels, except
in the Navy, where there's captains. Then there's lieutenant colonels,
then majors and captains . . ."</p>

<p>Things are easier in grad school. Just call everyone with a tie
"Professor," and anyone with a beard "Dean." When in doubt, just say
"Doctor."</p>

<p>Well, every couple days the hacker would log into my system and
read the SDINET files. If he had any doubts about the validity of this
information, he never showed it. In fact, he soon began trying to log
into military computers using the account SDINET.</p>

<p>Why not? Some of these ersatz files described network links into
Milnet computers. I made sure they were crammed with lots of jargon
and technobabble.</p>

<p>Still, feeding the hacker bait wasn't leading us to an
arrest. Every time he appeared, we traced him all right, but I kept
waiting for a phone call saying, "He's at the police station now."</p>

<p>Now that the Germans had a suspect in mind, Mike Gibbons met with
the U.S. attorney in Virginia. The FBI's news was mixed: if a German
citizen is involved, extradition is unlikely, unless there's
underlying espionage.<a id="p251" name="p251"></a></p>

<p>By the end of the week, the hacker had returned for five more
sessions, each an hour or more. He checked into the Navy and Army
computers, making sure that they still let him in. I wondered why they
hadn't closed their holes yet. Then he played around our laboratory
computer, again checking over the SDINET files.</p>

<p>Perhaps he worried that we knew he'd stolen Sventek's account, for
he found yet another unused account at our lab, changed its password,
and began using it for his hacking.</p>

<p>With all the high-powered computer folks in my department, I
worried that one of them would post a notice to an electronic bulletin
board, or casually leak the story in a conversation. The hacker still
searched our system for words like "security" and "hacker," so he'd
stumble onto this news and our bird would fly the coop.</p>

<p>The Germans had promised a bust this weekend. The hacker had what I
hoped was his last fling on Thursday, January 22, when he broke into a
computer at Bolt, Beranak, and Newman, in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. This computer, called the Butterfly-vax, was as
unprotected as the rest: you just logged in as "guest," with no
password.</p>

<p>I'd heard of BBN&#8212;they had built the Milnet. In fact, most of
the Milnet would soon be controlled by their Butterfly computers. The
hacker had found a particularly sensitive computer&#8212;if he planted
the right kind of Trojan horse in this computer, he might steal all
the passwords that ever crossed the Milnet. For this was where BBN
developed their network software.</p>

<p>Stealing passwords at Lawrence Berkeley Labs only gives you access
to nearby computers. The place to booby-trap software is where it's
distributed. Slip a logic bomb into the development software; it'll be
copied along with the valid programs and shipped to the rest of the
country. A year later, your treacherous code will infest hundreds of
computers.</p>

<p>The hacker understood this, but probably didn't realize that he'd
stumbled into such a development system. He searched the system and
found one glaring security hole: the root account needed no
password. Anyone could log in as system manager without so much as a
challenge. Whoa!</p>

<p>Someone was sure to discover such an obvious hole, so he wasted no
time in exploiting it. He became system<a id="p252" name="p252"></a>
manager and created a new, privileged account. Even if the original
flaw was discovered, he'd added a new backdoor into BBN's
computer.</p>

<p>He created an account under the name Langman, with a password of
"Bbnhack." I understood the password, all right, but why Langman?
Could that be his real name? The German Bundespost won't tell me, but
maybe the hacker himself did. What's the meaning of the name
Langman?</p>

<p>No time to worry about it now. The hacker found a letter on the BBN
computer, saying, "Hi, Dick! You can use my account at the University
of Rochester. Log in as Thomas, with the password 'trytedj' ..."</p>

<p>It didn't take him fifteen seconds to reach into the Rochester
computer. He then spent an hour reading information about integrated
circuit designs. Apparently, a graduate student at Rochester designed
sub-micron circuits, using an advanced computer-controlled
technique. The hacker started to grab everything, including the
programs.</p>

<p>I wouldn't let him: this would be industrial espionage. Every time
he started to copy some interesting files, I jingled my keys on the
wires. He could look, but he'd better not touch. Finally, at 5:30, he
gave up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I wondered about the word Langman. Was it someone's
name?</p>

<p>Aah&#8212;there's a way to find out. Look it up in the phone
book. Maggie Morley, our librarian, couldn't find a Hannover telephone
directory, so she ordered one. A week later, with suitable aplomb,
Maggie delivered the Deutschen Bundespost Telefonbuch, issue number
seventeen, covering Ortsnetz and Hannover, with a rubber stamp on the
side, "Funk-Taxi, 3811."</p>

<p>My atlas presented a dry, geographic Hannover. And the tourist
guides spoke of a historic, scenic city, nestled along the river
Leine. But the phone book, well, here's the city: the opticians, the
fabric stores, a few dozen autohauses, even a perfumerie. And people
... I spent an hour just paging through the white pages, imagining a
whole different world. There were listings for Lang, Langhardt,
Langheim, and Langheinecke, but not one Langman. Bum steer.</p>

<p>Steve White relayed a message from Germany. The Germans had been
doing their homework. Apparently, when<a id="p253" name="p253"></a>
the hacker called a phone, the German police had printed out that
phone number. Eventually, they figured out who was involved, just by
piecing together the web of phone calls centered on the hacker.</p>

<p>Were the German authorities planning a simultaneous bust? Tymnet
passed along a chilling message: "This is not a benign hacker. It is
quite serious. The scope of the investigation is being
extended. Thirty people are now working on this case. Instead of
simply breaking into the apartments of one or two people, locksmiths
are making keys to the houses of the hackers, and the arrests will be
made when the hackers cannot destroy the evidence."</p>

<h3>45</h3>

<p class="first">If you pester an organization long enough, eventually
they'll hold a meeting. After all my calls to the FBI, NSA, CIA, and
DOE, it was the Air Force Office of Special Investigations that gave
in first. On February 4, they invited everyone to Bolling Air Force
Base, in hopes of resolving the problem.</p>

<p>Suburban Washington's world is measured by position on the
beltway. Bolling Air Force Base is somewhere around five o'clock, sort
of south by southeast. Even with such explicit directions, I got
royally lost: bicycling along Berkeley side streets isn't quite the
same as driving a car around a DC highway.</p>

<p>At 11:30, three Department of Energy people met me at a restaurant
near the Air Force base. Over some tortellini, we talked about DOE's
computer security policies. They worry about atomic bomb secrets. But
they're also painfully aware that security gets in the way of
operations. High-security computers are difficult to get onto, and
unfriendly to use. Open, friendly systems are usually insecure.</p>

<p>Then we went to Bolling. It was the first time I'd ever walked on a
military base. The movies are accurate: people salute officers, and
some poor guy at the guardhouse spends his day saluting every car that
comes through. Nobody<a id="p254" name="p254"></a> saluted me, of
course&#8212;with long hair, jeans, and a beat-up jacket, a Martian
would have been less conspicuous.</p>

<p>About twenty people showed up, from all the three-letter
agencies. At last I could hook voices from the telephone to people's
faces. Mike Gibbons actually did look like an FBI agent&#8212;thirty
years old or so, neatly pressed suit, mustache, and probably lifted
weights in his spare time. We talked about microcomputers for a
while&#8212;he knew the Atari operating system inside and out. Jim
Christy, the Air Force computer crime investigator, was tall, lanky,
and exuded confidence. And there was Teejay, sitting over in the
corner of the room, silent as ever.</p>

<p>Barrel-chested and smiling, Zeke Hanson of the NSA greeted me with
a slap on the back. He knew his way around both computers and
bureaucracies. Occasionally, he whispered interpretations like, "That
guy's important to your cause" or "She's just spouting the party
line." I felt uncomfortable among all the suits, but with Zeke's
encouragement I managed to stand up and talk to the gathering.</p>

<p>I babbled for a while, describing the network connections and weak
spots, and then the others discussed national policy on computer
security. Seems that there wasn't any.</p>

<p>Through the whole meeting, people kept asking, "Who's in charge?" I
looked over at the contingent from the FBI. Mike Gibbons, the agent
handling this case, squirmed in his chair. Sitting next to Mike,
George Lane of the FBI handled the questions. "Since we can't
extradite the guy, the FBI isn't going to devote many resources to
this case. We've already done all we can."</p>

<p>The DOE people didn't let this slide. "We've been begging you to
call the Germans. They're begging you to contact them. But Bonn still
hasn't seen your warrant."</p>

<p>"Uh, we've had a few problems in our Legal office, but that doesn't
concern us here," Lane said. "The bottom line is that there's been no
damage done by this hacker."</p>

<p>Russ Mundy, a wiry colonel from the Defense Communication Agency,
could take it no longer. "No damage! This guy breaks into two dozen
military computers and it's no damage? He's stealing computer time and
network connections. Not to mention programs, data, and
passwords. How<a id="p255" name="p255"></a> long do we have to wait
before he gets into something really serious?"</p>

<p>"But no classified data has been compromised," the FBI agent
said. "And how much money has been lost&#8212;75 cents of computer
time in Berkeley?"</p>

<p>I listened as the colonel tried a different approach. "We rely on
our networks for communications. Not just military people, but
engineers, students, secretaries, hell, even astronomers," he said,
gesturing towards me. "This bastard is undermining the trust that
holds our community together."</p>

<p>The FBI saw the hacker as a minor annoyance; perhaps just some kid
messing around after school. The military people took it as a serious
attack on their communications lines.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice backed up the FBI. "Germany won't
extradite a German citizen, so why bother? And anyway, the FBI gets a
hundred reports like this every year, and we can prosecute only one or
two."</p>

<p>He went on to say that we already had enough evidence to convict
the hacker: my logbook and printouts would stand up at a trial. And
according to U.S. law, we didn't have to catch the
hacker <em>flagrante delicto:</em> busting in on him while he was
connected to a foreign computer. "So you really ought to close up
shop. You're not strengthening your case, and we already have enough
evidence to bring him to trial."</p>

<p>In the end, the Air Force OSI asked each group for direction. The
FBI and Department of Justice wanted us to close up shop and lock the
hacker out of our Berkeley computer. Neither Teejay of the CIA nor
Zeke of NSA's National Computer Security Center felt there was
anything to gain by staying open.</p>

<p>Leon Breault of the Department of Energy stood up. "We've got to
support the guys in the trenches and catch this guy. If the FBI won't,
then we will," he said, glaring at the Department of Justice
attorney.</p>

<p>The people being hit by the hacker wanted to keep the monitoring
going. Closing our monitoring station just meant that the hacker would
prowl around using a different, unobserved pathway.</p>

<p>But who should we turn to for help? The FBI didn't want<a id="p256"
name="p256"></a> to touch the case. The military groups had no
authority to issue warrants.</p>

<p>Where was a clearinghouse for reporting problems? This hacker had
shown us several novel computer security problems. Who should we
report them to?</p>

<p>Why, to the National Computer Security Center, of course. But Zeke
told me otherwise: "We set standards for secure computers, and stay
away from operational problems. All the same, we're always willing to
collect reports from the field."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but will you warn me about other's problems?" I asked. "Will
you send me a report describing security holes in my computer? Can you
call me on the phone if someone's trying to break into my
computer?"</p>

<p>"No, we're an information collection point." Just what I'd expect
from an organization run by NSA. The giant vacuum cleaner that sucks
in information, yet never says a thing.</p>

<p>Suppose I find a computer security problem, and it's
widespread. Perhaps I should keep my mouth shut, and hope that nobody
else figures it out. Fat chance.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I should tell the world. Post a notice to lots of
electronic bulletin boards saying, "Hey, you can break into any Unix
computer by . . ." That would at least wake up the folks who manage
the systems. Maybe even prod them into action.</p>

<p>Or should I create a virus, one that takes advantage of this
security hole?</p>

<p>If there were a trusted clearinghouse, I could report to
them. They, in turn, could figure out a patch for the problem, and see
that systems are fixed. The National Computer Security Center seemed
like a logical place for this. After all, they specialize in computer
security problems.</p>

<p>But they didn't want to touch it. The NCSC was too busy designing
secure computers. For the past few years, they'd published an
unreadable series of documents describing what they meant by a secure
computer. In the end, to prove that a computer was secure, they'd hire
a couple programmers to try to break into the system. Not a very
reassuring proof of security. How many holes did the programmers
miss?<a id="p257" name="p257"></a></p>

<p>The meeting at Bolling Air Force Base broke up with the FBI and
Department of Justice dead set against our continuing to monitor the
hacker. The CIA and NSA didn't say much, and the military groups and
the Department of Energy wanted us to stay open. Since DOE paid our
bills, we'd stay open, so long as an arrest seemed likely.</p>

<p>While I was around Washington, Zeke Hanson invited me to give a
talk at the National Computer Security Center. It's just down the road
from Fort Meade, NSA's headquarters; even so, I got lost trying to
find the place. There, under the exhaust of Baltimore Airport, a guard
inspected my backpack for floppy disks, tape recorders, and
viewgraphs.</p>

<p>"Hey, what can I steal on a viewgraph?"</p>

<p>The guard scowled. "Them's our orders. Make trouble and you won't
pass." He had a pistol on his side. OK.</p>

<p>You enter the meeting room through a door with a combination
lock. Twenty people greeted me, leaving one chair empty, up near the
front of the room. Ten minutes into my talk, a thin, bearded fellow
wandered into the room, sat down in front, and interrupted my
description of Tymnet's traces.</p>

<p>"What's the adiabatic lapse rate on Jupiter?"</p>

<p>Huh? I'm talking about transatlantic networks, and this guy asks me
about the atmosphere of Jupiter? Well, hot dog&#8212;I can handle
that.</p>

<p>"Oh about two degrees per kilometer, at least until you reach the
two hundred millibar level." By chance, this guy had asked me
something straight from my dissertation.</p>

<p>Well, I continued my story, and every ten minutes the bearded guy
stood up, left the room, and returned. He'd ask questions about the
core of the moon, the cratering history of Mars, and orbital
resonances among the moons of Jupiter. Weird. Nobody else seemed to
mind, so I dovetailed my talk on the hacker with technical responses
to this guy's astronomical interrogation.</p>

<p>About quarter to five, I finished up and was walking out of the
room (with a guard standing nearby). The bearded guy pulled me aside
and said to the guard, "It's OK, he's with me."</p>

<p>"What are you doing tonight?"</p>

<p>"Oh, going out to dinner with an astronomer friend."<a id="p258"
name="p258"></a></p>

<p>"Cool it. Tell him you'll be a couple hours late."</p>

<p>"Why? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you later. Call your friend now."</p>

<p>So I canceled my Friday evening dinner and was hustled into this
guy's dark blue Volvo. What's happening here? I don't even know his
name and I'm traveling down the road. Some sort of kidnapping, I
guess.</p>

<p>"I'm Bob Morris, the chief scientist at the Computer Security
Center," he said once we were on the highway. "We're going to Fort
Meade, where you'll meet Harry Daniels. He's the assistant director of
NSA. Tell him your story."</p>

<p>"But . . ."</p>

<p>"Just tell him what happened. I called him out of a congressional
meeting in Washington to meet you. He's driving up here right
now."</p>

<p>"But . . ." This guy wouldn't let me get a word in.</p>

<p>"Look, the atmosphere of Jupiter is fine&#8212;though I'd thought
all atmospheres were adiabatic so long as they convected&#8212;but
we've got a serious problem on our hands." Bob chain-smoked and kept
the windows rolled up. I gasped for breath. He went on, "We've got to
bring it to the attention of people who can do something about
it."</p>

<p>"Yesterday's meeting at Bolling was supposed to resolve that."</p>

<p>"Just tell your story."</p>

<p>If security at the Computer Security Center was tough, over at
NSA's headquarters&#8212;well, it took ten minutes to clear me
through. Bob had no problem: "This badge lets me in anywhere, so long
as I'm carrying a classified document."</p>

<p>He entered a password and slid the card through the badge reader;
meanwhile the guard fumbled with my viewgraphs. By the time we got to
the director's office, Harry Daniels had just arrived.</p>

<p>"This had better be important," he said, glaring at Bob. This guy
looked impressive&#8212;thin and about six-foot-six, he stooped when
walking through doors.</p>

<p>"It is. I wouldn't have called you otherwise," Bob said. "Cliff,
tell him."</p>

<p>There was no room on his table&#8212;it was covered
with<a id="p259" name="p259"></a> cryptography equipment&#8212;so I
spread out a diagram of the hacker's connections on the floor.</p>

<p>Harry Daniels followed the chart meticulously. "Does he use the
German Datex-P system to access the international record
carriers?"</p>

<p>Holy smoke! How does someone this important know communications
networks in such detail? I was impressed. I described the hacker's
break-ins, but the two of them wouldn't let me speak two sentences
without interrupting with a question.</p>

<p>Bob Morris nodded and said, "Here's your smoking gun, Harry."</p>

<p>The NSA honcho nodded.</p>

<p>The two of them talked for a few minutes, while I played with a
World War II Japanese encryption machine. I wished I'd brought my
Captain Midnight Secret Decoder Ring to show them.</p>

<p>"Cliff, this is important," Harry Daniels said. "I'm not sure we
can help you, but you can sure help us. We've had a real problem
convincing various entities that computer security is a problem. We'd
like you to talk to the National Telecommunications Security
Committee. They make national policy, and we'd like them to know about
this."</p>

<p>"Can't you just tell them?"</p>

<p>"We've been telling them for years," Harry Daniels said. "But this
is the first documented case."</p>

<p>Bob Morris continued. "Mind you, he said, 'Documented.' The only
difference between your case and others is that you've kept a
logbook."</p>

<p>"So this has been going on before?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have called Harry up from Washington if I didn't think
it was serious."</p>

<p>Driving back from Fort Meade, Bob Morris introduced himself. "I've
worked on Unix security for the past ten years, up at Bell Labs in New
Jersey."</p>

<p>Wait a second. This must be the Morris that invented the Unix
password protection scheme. I'd read papers by him about securing
computers. Of course&#8212;Bob Morris, the violinist. His eccentricity
was legendary: I'd heard stories of him eating dessert and lying down
so a cat could lick the whipped cream from his beard.<a id="p260"
name="p260"></a></p>

<p>Bob continued. "Next month's meeting will be for policy making. If
we're ever going to progress beyond writing standards documents, we've
got to demonstrate a danger to these people." At last&#8212;someone at
NSA who realized that computer security meant more than designing
computers. "Any system can be insecure. All you have to do is stupidly
manage it."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, that about sums it up," I agreed. "Some of the problems
are genuine design flaws&#8212;like the Gnu-Emacs security
hole&#8212;but most of them are from poor administration. The people
running our computers don't know how to secure them."</p>

<p>"We've got to turn this around," Bob said. "Secure computers might
keep the bad guys out, but if they're so balky that nobody will use
'em, it won't be much progress."</p>

<p>Tightening one computer was like securing an apartment house. But a
network of computers, all sharing files and interchanging mail, well,
this was like securing a small city. Bob, as chief scientist of the
Computer Security Center, directed that effort.</p>

<p>By the time we'd returned, I'd almost grown accustomed to riding in
a smoke-filled car. We started to argue about how planetary orbits
interact&#8212;a subject that I ought to be able to hold my own
in. But this guy knew his celestial mechanics. Ouch. I'd been away
from astronomy too long if I couldn't bat off his questions.</p>

<h3>46</h3>

<p class="first">It was neat to talk with Bob Morris. Still, I was
glad to come back home to Martha. I caught the bus home from the
airport and jaywalked across College Avenue&#8212;striking another
blow for anarchy. My roommate, Claudia, was practicing her violin when
I walked in the door.</p>

<p>Claudia greeted me with a teasing smile. "Where have you
been&#8212;running around with loose women, I bet!"</p>

<p>"Nope. Meeting dark, handsome spies with trench coats, in dark
alleys."<a id="p261" name="p261"></a></p>

<p>"Did you bring one home for me?" Claudia was perpetually on the
lookout for a good man.</p>

<p>I didn't have time to get out a clever answer, because Martha
caught me from behind in a bear hug, and hoisted me into the air. "I
missed you," she said, setting me down with a kiss. It's fun, but a
little startling, to live with a woman who can beat me in a wrestling
match.</p>

<p>I was worried that she'd be mad that I had gone away again, but she
shrugged. "You're in time for dinner, so you're fine. Get in the
kitchen and help."</p>

<p>Martha was making her famous curry, which started with fresh
coconut. I was out on the back porch whacking a coconut with a hammer
when I heard Laurie pull up on her motorcycle.</p>

<p>Laurie was Martha's best friend and college roommate. Despite her
fierce exterior&#8212;crew cut, leather jacket, boots and black muscle
shirt&#8212;she was a gentle country girl from New Mexico. She and
Martha shared a special bond that made me just slightly jealous. But I
guess I passed her test, for she treated us both as family.</p>

<p>"Hey, differ," she greeted me, mussing my hair. Looking hungrily at
the coconut, she guessed what we were having. She tromped inside,
hugged Martha, winked at Claudia, and scooped up the cat.</p>

<p>"Put that lazy thing down and chop some onions." Martha was kitchen
despot.</p>

<p>At last, dinner was on the table: a platter of curried rice, and
dishes of chopped vegetables, nuts, raisins, fruit, and chutney. If it
grows, Martha will curry it.</p>

<p>"Hey, where've you been for the past couple days?" Laurie asked
me.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was summoned to Washington&#8212;the Reagans, you know,
asked me to dinner," I answered. I didn't want to say that I'd just
talked to a bunch of spies and spooks. Laurie hated the government,
and I didn't want to get her started.</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell what Nancy was wearing," Laurie simpered, taking a
third helping of curry. "Hey, what's the latest on that hacker that
you were chasing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we haven't caught him yet. Maybe never will."<a id="p262"
name="p262"></a></p>

<p>"Still think he's a Berkeley student?" I hadn't talked to Laurie
about this thing for a couple months.</p>

<p>"Hard to say. For all I know, he's coming from abroad." I was
getting nervous, surprised at my own reluctance to tell a close friend
what I'd been up to. I wasn't ashamed, exactly, but . . .</p>

<p>"Why are you spending so much time trying to catch some poor
computer geek who's just fooling around?"</p>

<p>"Fooling around? He broke into thirty military computers."
Whoops. Instantly, I wanted to unsay that.</p>

<p>"So what? That sounds like a good reason not to chase him," Laurie
said. "For all you know, he's a pacifist from the German Green
party. Maybe he's trying to find out what secret weird things the
military is doing, and expose them to public scrutiny."</p>

<p>I'd thought of that months ago and worried about it then. By now I
was certain those weren't his motives. I had done the obvious
experiment: categorize his interests. Back in January, I'd created a
variety of different-flavored baits. Alongside the bogus SDINET files,
I'd placed equally counterfeit files about Berkeley's local
politics. Other files appeared to be financial statements, payroll
accounts, games, and academic computer science topics.</p>

<p>If he were a peace activist, he might look at those political
files. A thief, interested in ripping off our lab's payroll, would go
for the financial records. And I'd expect a student or computer nerd
to reach for the games or academic files. But he wasn't interested in
any of these.</p>

<p>Except the SDI files.</p>

<p>This experiment, and a lot of more subtle things about his way of
operating, convinced me that he was no idealist. This hacker was a
spy.</p>

<p>But I couldn't exactly prove that, and even after I explained my
experiment to Laurie, she wasn't convinced.</p>

<p>She still thought of anyone working against the military as one of
"us," and in her eyes I was persecuting someone on "our own" side.</p>

<p>How do I explain that, having been mixed up in this thing so long,
I had stopped seeing clear political boundaries? All of us had common
interests: myself, my lab, the FBI, the<a id="p263" name="p263"></a>
CIA, NSA, military groups, and yes, even Laurie. Each of us desired
security and privacy.</p>

<p>I tried a different tack. "Look, it's not a question of politics,
but simple honesty. This guy violated my privacy and the privacy of
all the other users. If someone broke into your house and rifled
through your stuff, would you stop to ask if they were a fellow
socialist?"</p>

<p>That didn't work either. "A computer system isn't private like a
house," Laurie responded. "Lots of people use it for many
purposes. Just because this guy doesn't have official permission to
use it doesn't necessarily mean he has no legitimate purpose in being
there."</p>

<p>"It's damned well exactly like a house. You don't want someone
poking around in your diary, and you sure as hell don't want them
messing with your data. Breaking into these systems is trespassing
without permission. It's wrong no matter what your purpose is. And I
have a right to ask these government agencies to help me get rid of
this bastard. That's their job!"</p>

<p>My voice had risen, and Martha looked anxiously from my angry face
to Laurie's. I realized that I sounded like a shotgun-toting redneck,
yelling about law and order. Or worse&#8212;was I so blindly patriotic
that I thought anyone who had an interest in military secrets was a
traitor or a Commie spy?</p>

<p>I felt trapped and confused, and, unfairly, felt it was all
Laurie's fault for being so simplistic and self-righteous. She hadn't
had to deal with this hacker, and hadn't had to call on the CIA for
help, hadn't talked to them and found they were real people. She
thought of them as comic-book villains, killing innocent peasants in
Central America. And maybe some of them were. But did that make it
wrong to work with them at all?</p>

<p>I couldn't talk anymore. I got up, rudely pushing away my
half-finished plate of curry. I stomped off to the garage, to sand
some bookcases we were making, and sulk in peace.</p>

<p>After an hour or so, it got harder to keep up the sulking. I
thought of the fireplace, pie for dessert, and Laurie's great back
rubs. But, having grown up in a large, argumentative family, I was a
dedicated, world-class sulker. I stayed in the cold garage, sanding
furiously.<a id="p264" name="p264"></a></p>

<p>I suddenly noticed that Laurie was standing quietly by the
door. "Cliff," she said softly, "I really didn't mean to give you such
a hard time. Martha's crying in the kitchen. Come on, let's go
inside."</p>

<p>I thought of how easily I hurt Martha with my temper. I didn't want
to spoil the rest of the evening, so I went inside. We hugged, Martha
wiped her face, and then served dessert. The rest of the evening, we
talked brightly of other things.</p>

<p>But the questions Laurie had stirred up inside me came back to
haunt me through the night. I lay awake and wondered where all this
was leading me, and what kind of person I was being turned into by
this strange chase.</p>

<p>I took flack from all directions, of course. The spooks didn't
trust me&#8212;I had no security clearance and didn't work for a
defense contractor. Nobody had asked me to do this work, and we ran on
zero budget. And how do I tell my Berkeley friends that I'd just
returned from the CIA?</p>

<p>Since we had neither funding nor authority, the three-letter
agencies saw no reason to listen to us. I was little more than an
annoyance to them. I felt like a grad student again.</p>

<p>A week after I'd returned, Mike Gibbons called from the FBI. "We're
closing our end of the investigation. There's no reason for you to
stay open."</p>

<p>"Mike, is that you speaking, or one of your bosses?"</p>

<p>"It's the FBI's official policy," Mike said, obviously annoyed.</p>

<p>"Has the Legal Attach&#233; ever talked to the Germans?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but there's confusion. The German federal police&#8212; the
BKA&#8212;aren't running the phone traces, so not much information
filters back to the Legat's office. You might as well close up
shop."</p>

<p>"What'll that do for the rest of the sites the hacker decides to
hit?"</p>

<p>"Let them worry about it. Most of them won't care anyway."</p>

<p>Mike was right. Some of the places that had been broken into really
didn't care if they'd been hit. The Pentagon's Optimis database, for
example. Mike had notified them that a foreigner was using their
computer. They didn't bat an<a id="p265" name="p265"></a>
eyelash. Today, for all I know, anyone can read about the Army's
nuclear and biological warfare plans by logging onto their computer
as <em>Anonymous,</em> with password <em>Guest.</em></p>

<p>But though the FBI wanted us to close up, the Department of Energy
still supported us. Halfway between, the CIA and NSA didn't say one
way or another.</p>

<p>No support either. For all that we'd told them, the NSA had never
coughed up a nickel. And while it might seem fun to rub shoulders with
secret agents, it did little for my astronomy, and even less for my
reputation.</p>

<p>For several weeks during February, the hacker evaporated. None of
my alarms went off, and his accounts remained dormant. Was he on to
us? Had someone tipped him off to his impending arrest? Or was he
sneaking through other computers?</p>

<p>Whatever the answer, his disappearance relieved some of the
pressure to decide. For three weeks, I had nothing to report, so it
made no difference if we stayed open. Without a half dozen agencies on
my neck, I managed to actually write some software during that
time.</p>

<p>Then, routinely scanning my monitor's printouts, I noticed someone
using the Lawrence Berkeley Lab's Petvax computer. It looked like they
were entering the Petvax from a Caltech computer called Cithex.</p>

<p>I'd been warned about Cithex&#8212;Dan Kolkowitz at Stanford had
noticed German hackers using that system to break into his
computers. So I looked closely at the traffic from our Petvax to the
Cithex computer.</p>

<p>Yeah. There it was. Someone had connected into the Caltech machine
from the Petvax, and was trying to break into a place called Tinker,
in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Tinker? I looked it up in the Milnet directory. Tinker Air Force
Base.</p>

<p>Uh oh. A little bit later, there's a connection into the Optimis
database at the Pentagon. Then he tries the Letterman Army
Institute. The Comptroller of the Army at Fort Harrison.</p>

<p>Oh hell. If it's not the same hacker, then someone's behaving just
like him. That's why the hacker's been quiet for three weeks. He's
been using a different set of computers to get onto the
Milnet.<a id="p266" name="p266"></a></p>

<p>Obviously, closing up my laboratory's security holes won't keep him
off the networks. This pestilence would have to be eradicated at the
source.</p>

<p>The Petvax, of all computers! An outsider would think it's a
toy&#8212;after all, a pet Vax computer, no?</p>

<p>Hardly. Pet is an acronym for Positron Emission Tomography. It's a
medical diagnostic technique to locate where oxygen is consumed in
people's brains. By injecting a patient with an activated isotope,
LBL's scientists create images of the brain's interior. All you need
is a particle accelerator to create radioactive isotopes, a
hypersensitive particle detector, and a powerful computer.</p>

<p>That computer is the petvax. Stored within it are patient records,
analysis programs, medical data, and scans of people's brains.</p>

<p>This hacker was playing games with medical tools. Break this
computer, and someone's going to get hurt. A bad diagnosis or a
dangerous injection. Or what?</p>

<p>The doctors and patients who used this instrument needed it to work
perfectly. This was a sensitive medical device, not a plaything for
some cyberpunk. Some poor computer geek, indeed.</p>

<p>Was it the same hacker? Two minutes after he disconnected from the
Petvax, he entered my Unix computer, using the name Sventek. Nobody
else knew that password.</p>

<p>We locked up the Petvax, changing its passwords and setting alarms
on it. But the incident worried me. How many other computers was this
hacker slithering through?</p>

<p>On February 27, Tymnet forwarded some electronic mail from Wolfgang
Hoffman of the Bundespost. Apparently the German police can only
arrest the hackers while they're connected. There's no shortage of
evidence to bring them to trial, but without positive identification,
the charges won't stick. We had to catch them red-handed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one of the LBL computer masters described the whole
incident to a programmer at the Lawrence Livermore Lab. He, in turn,
sent out electronic mail to several dozen people, saying that he was
going to invite me to give a talk on "how we caught the German
hackers." Dumb.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after he posted his note, three people
called<a id="p267" name="p267"></a> me up, each asking, "I thought you
were keeping this hush-hush. Why the sudden publicity?"</p>

<p>Terrific. How do I undo this? If the hacker sees the note, it's all
over.</p>

<p>John Erlichman observed that once you squeeze the toothpaste tube,
it's tough to get the stuff back in. I called Livermore; it took five
minutes to convince them to erase the message from all of their
systems. But how do we prevent this kind of leak in the future?</p>

<p>Well, I could start by keeping my officemates better informed. From
now on, every week I told them what was happening and why we had to
keep quiet. It worked remarkably well . . . tell people the truth, and
they'll respect your need for secrecy.</p>

<p>The hacker showed up occasionally during March. Just often enough
to upset my life, but not quite enough to let the Germans nail
him.</p>

<p>Thursday, March 12, was an overcast Berkeley day. Dry in the
morning, so I biked in without a raincoat. At 12:19, the hacker
visited his old haunt for a couple minutes. Listed a few of my SDINET
files&#8212;he found out that Barbara Sherwin had recently bought a
car and that SDINET was expanding overseas. He saw the names of thirty
new documents, but he didn't read them. Why not?</p>

<p>Steve White had shown up in town, passing through to visit Ron
Vivier at Tymnet's office in Silicon Valley. He and Martha and I had a
date at a Thai restaurant, so I had to be home by six.</p>

<p>It started to rain about four, and I realized that I would get
drenched bicycling home. Not much choice in the matter, so I insanely
biked home&#8212;the rain turned the bike's brakes into banana
peels. My raincoat wouldn't have been much defense against the sheet
of water thrown up by an old DeSoto. Traffic splashed me from the
side, and my bike's tires got me from below.</p>

<p>By the time I got home, I was sopping wet. Well, I've plenty of dry
clothes. But only one pair of shoes. The grungy sneakers I was
wearing. And they were soaked. I couldn't dry 'em out in time, so I
looked around. There's Claudia's new microwave oven. I wonder
. . .</p>

<p>So I popped my sneakers into Claudia's microwave, and<a id="p268"
name="p268"></a> pressed a few buttons. The display read "120." I
wondered whether that meant 120 seconds, 120 watts, 120 degrees, or
120 light-years. I dunno.</p>

<p>It didn't make any difference. I'd just watch the sneakers through
the window and make sure nothing goes wrong. For the first few
seconds, no problem. Then the phone rang.</p>

<p>I ran into the front room to answer it. It was Martha.</p>

<p>"I'll be home in half an hour, honey," she said. "Don't forget
dinner with Steve White."</p>

<p>"I'm getting ready right now. Uh, Martha, how do I set the
microwave oven?"</p>

<p>"You don't need to. We're going out for dinner, remember?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I want to dry out my sneakers," I said. "What should I set
on the microwave?"</p>

<p>"Be serious."</p>

<p>"I am being serious. My sneakers are wet."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare put them in the microwave."</p>

<p>"Well, theoretically speaking, how long should I hypothetically set
the microwave for?"</p>

<p>"Don't even think about it. I'll come home and show you how to dry
them out."</p>

<p>"Well, uh, sweetheart," I tried to interrupt.</p>

<p>"No. Don't touch the microwave," she said. "Just sit tight. Bye for
now."</p>

<p>As I hung up the phone, I heard four beeps from the kitchen. Uh
oh.</p>

<p>Boiling out of the back of Claudia's new Panasonic microwave oven
was an angry cloud of thick, black smoke. The kind you see in
newsreels, when the oil refinery blows up. And the stench&#8212;it
smelled like an old tire burning.</p>

<p>I swung open the microwave, and another cloud of smoke belched
out. I reached in and tried pulling out the sneakers&#8212; they still
looked like sneakers, but had the texture of hot mozzarella cheese. I
tossed them and the glass tray out the kitchen window. The tray
shattered in the driveway, and the smoldering sneakers lay seething
next to the plum tree.</p>

<p>Now I'm in deep yogurt. Martha's due home in half an hour and the
kitchen smells like Akron during the tire-burning festival. Time to
clean up the mess.</p>

<p>I got out the paper towels and started scrubbing the<a id="p269"
name="p269"></a> microwave. Black soot all over. Not the kind of soot
that washes away, either. Wiping the glop only spreads the black
plague further.</p>

<p>Half an hour. How do you get rid of the delicate fragrance of
burning rubber? I swung open the windows and door, letting the wind
blow the stench away. It didn't do much for the smell, and now the
rain was blowing in the windows.</p>

<p>When you make a mess, cover it up. I remembered a homemakers'
column: to mask household aromas, boil a small amount of vanilla on
the stove. Well, it can't make things worse. I dump a couple of ounces
of vanilla in a pan and crank up the heat.</p>

<p>Sure enough, in a couple minutes, the vanilla works. The kitchen no
longer smells like a burning old blackwall tire. No, now it smells
like a burning new whitewall tire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm cleaning the walls and ceiling. But I forgot the
vanilla. The vanilla evaporates, the pot burns, and I've now screwed
up twice. Three times, if you count the soggy floor.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes. What to do? Appeasement. I'll bake her some
cookies. Reach into the refrigerator for last night's cookie dough,
and slap lumps of it onto a cookie pan. Set the oven at 375, just
right for chocolate chips.</p>

<p>Well, a third of the cookies slid off the pan and stuck on the
bottom of the oven where they turned to cinders.</p>

<p>Martha walks in, takes one sniff, sees the black welt on the
ceiling, and says, "You didn't."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"I told you."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry twice."</p>

<p>"But I said . . ."</p>

<p>The doorbell rings. Steve White enters, and with British aplomb
says, "I say, old chap. Is there a tire factory nearby?"<a id="p270"
name="p270"></a></p>

<h3>47</h3>

<p class="first">Through March and early April, the hacker laid
low. Occasionally, he'd pop in, just long enough to keep his accounts
on the active list. But he seemed uninterested in reaching into other
computers, and pretty much ignored my new SDINET files. What was
happening to this guy? If he's been arrested, he wouldn't show up
here. And if he's busy on other projects, why does he just show up for
a minute, then disappear?</p>

<p>On April 14, I was working on the Unix system when I noticed Marv
Atchley logged into the system.</p>

<p>Odd. Marv's upstairs, giving a pep talk to some programmers. I
wandered over to his cubicle and looked at his terminal. Not even
turned on.</p>

<p>Who's using Marv's account? I ran over to the switchyard and saw
someone coming in through our Tymnet port. They were connected into
the system as Marv Atchley.</p>

<p>I called Tymnet&#8212;Steve traced the line quickly. "It's from
Hannover, Germany. Are you sure it's not the hacker?"</p>

<p>"Hard to say. I'll call you right back."</p>

<p>I ran up four flights of stairs and peered into the conference
room. Yep, there was Marv Atchley, giving an animated talk to
twenty-five programmers.</p>

<p>By the time I returned to the switchyard, the pseudo-Marv was
gone. But I could see that he'd entered the system without any
tricks. Otherwise he would have set off my alarms. Whoever it was must
know Marv's password.</p>

<p>When the meeting ended, I showed the printout to Marv.</p>

<p>"Damned if I know who it is. I sure never gave my password to
anyone.</p>

<p>"How long since you changed it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a few weeks ago."</p>

<p>"And what's your password?"</p>

<p>"Messiah. I'll change it right now."</p>

<p>How the hell did this hacker get Marv's password? I<a id="p271"
name="p271"></a> would have noticed if he'd set a Trojan horse. Could
he have guessed the word "Messiah"?</p>

<p>Uh oh. There's a way he could have.</p>

<p>Our passwords are stored encrypted. You can search the entire
computer, and you'll never find the word "Messiah." You will find it
encrypted as "p3kqznqiewe." Our password file was filled with such
encrypted gibberish. And there's no way to reconstruct the avocado
from that guacamole.</p>

<p>But you can guess passwords. Suppose the hacker tried to log in as
Marv, then tried the password "Aardvark." My system says, "no good."
The hacker, being persistent, then tries again, using the password
"Aaron." Again, no luck.</p>

<p>One by one, he tries to log on using passwords that he looks up in
a dictionary. Eventually, he tries the password "Messiah." The door
opens wide.</p>

<p>Each trial takes a couple seconds. His fingers would wear out
before he tried the whole dictionary. Such a brute-force method of
guessing passwords will only work on a completely mismanaged
computer.</p>

<p>But I saw this hacker copy our password file into his own
computer. How could he use a list of our encrypted passwords?</p>

<p>The Unix password scheme uses an encryption program that's
public. Anyone can get a copy of it&#8212;it's posted to bulletin
boards. With a hundred thousand Unix computers in the world, you
couldn't keep the program secret.</p>

<p>The Unix encryption program works in one direction only: it will
encrypt from English text into gibberish. You can't reverse the
process to translate encrypted passwords into English.</p>

<p>But with this encryption program, you can encrypt every word in the
dictionary. Make a list of encrypted English words from your
dictionary. Then, it's a simple matter to compare what's in my
password file to your list of encrypted passwords. This must be how
the hacker is cracking passwords.</p>

<p>On his computer in Hannover, he'd run the Unix password encryption
program. He'd feed it the whole dictionary, and one by one, his
program would encrypt every word in the English language. Something
like this:<a id="p272" name="p272"></a></p>

<p>Aardvark encrypts to "vi4zkcvlsfz." Is that the same as
"p3kqznqiewe"? No, so go on to the next word in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Aaron encrypts to "zzolegcklgS." Not the same as "p3kqznqiewe," so
go on to the next word in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Eventually, his program would discover that Messiah encrypts to
"p3kqznqiewe."</p>

<p>When his program found a match, bingo&#8212;it would print it
out.</p>

<p>My hacker was cracking passwords using a dictionary. He could find
anyone's password, so long as it was an English word.</p>

<p>This was serious stuff. It meant that every time I'd seen him copy
a password file, he could now figure out legitimate users'
passwords. Bad news. I checked my logbook. He'd copied these files
from our Unix computer, the Anniston system, and the Navy Coastal
Systems Command. I wondered if he'd be back in those computers.</p>

<p>Hey&#8212;I'd proven that he was cracking passwords on his
computer. There are around a hundred thousand words in an English
dictionary. It had been about three weeks since he copied my password
file. If his password cracker worked continually for three weeks,
could he have guessed Marv's password?</p>

<p>Well, on an ordinary Vax computer, it takes about a second to
encrypt one password. A hundred thousand words, then, would take
around a day. On an IBM PC, maybe a month. A Cray supercomputer might
take an hour.</p>

<p>But according to Marv, this guy did it in three weeks. So he wasn't
using a little home computer. He must be running the password cracker
on a Vax or a Sun workstation. I had to be careful about this
conclusion, though. He might use a faster algorithm or have waited a
few days after cracking Marv's password.</p>

<p>Still, I patted myself on the back. Just by noticing that he'd been
cracking passwords, I knew what type of computer he was
using. Remote-control detective work.</p>

<p>This explained why he'd always copied our password files to his
system. He was cracking our passwords in Germany.</p>

<p>Even one guessed password was dangerous. Now, if I<a id="p273"
name="p273"></a> erased Sventek's account, he could sneak in on
someone else's account. Good thing that I'd not closed the door on
him. What I'd thought to be bulletproof&#8212;my passwords&#8212;
turned out to be riddled with holes.</p>

<p>Password cracking. I'd not come across it before, but I suppose
that experts had. Well, what do the experts say about it? I called Bob
Morris, the big shot I'd met at NSA. He'd invented the Unix password
encryption system.</p>

<p>"I think the hacker's cracking my passwords," I told Bob.</p>

<p>"Eh?" Bob was obviously interested. "Is he using a dictionary or
has he actually reversed the data encryption algorithm?"</p>

<p>"A dictionary, I think."</p>

<p>"Big deal. Why, I've got three good password cracking programs. One
of them will pre-compute the passwords, so it runs a couple hundred
times faster. Want a copy?"</p>

<p>Egads, he was offering me a copy of a password-cracking program!
"Uh, no, I don't think so," I said. "If I ever need to decrypt
passwords, though, I'll call you. Say, how long have people known
about password cracking?"</p>

<p>"This kind of brute force stuff? Oh maybe five or ten years. It's
child's play."</p>

<p>Cracking passwords as a game? What kind of a guy is this?</p>

<p>Bob continued. "Guessing won't work when you choose good
passwords. Our real concern is with the encryption programs. If
someone figures out a way to reverse that software, we're in deep
trouble."</p>

<p>I now understood what he meant. The program that translated
"Messiah" into "p3kqznqiewe" is a one-way street. It needs just a
second to encrypt your password. But if someone found a way to crank
that sausage machine backwards&#8212;a way to convert "p3kqznqiewe"
into "Messiah"&#8212;then they could figure out every password,
without guessing.</p>

<p>Well, I'd at least told the NSA. Maybe they'd known these
techniques for years, but now they officially knew that someone else
was using them. Would they publicize it? Come to think of it, if NSA
had known of this for ten years, why hadn't they publicized it
already?<a id="p274" name="p274"></a></p>

<p>Systems designers needed to know about this problem&#8212;to build
stronger operating systems. Computer managers ought to know, too. And
every person who used a password should be warned. It's a simple rule:
don't pick passwords that might show up in a dictionary. Why hadn't
anyone told me?</p>

<p>The National Computer Security Center didn't seem interested in
real-world problems of thousands of Unix computers out in the field. I
wanted to know about weaknesses in my Unix system. What problems had
been reported? Before, I'd discovered a bug in the Gnu-Emacs editor. A
widespread security hole. I'd dutifully reported it to the National
Computer Security Center. But they never told anyone about it. Now,
I'd discovered that passwords that appeared in dictionaries weren't
safe.</p>

<p>How many other security holes were lurking in my system?</p>

<p>The NCSC might know, but they weren't saying.</p>

<p>NSA's motto, "Never Say Anything," seemed to come into play. Yet by
keeping silent about these computer security problems, they hurt us
all. I could see that the hackers had long ago discovered and
exploited these holes. Why wasn't someone telling the good guys?</p>

<p>"It's not our bailiwick," Bob Morris said. "We collect this
information so as to better design future computers."</p>

<p>Somewhere, somehow, something was wrong here. The guys in black
hats knew the combinations to our vaults. But the white hats were
silent.</p>

<p>Well, forget the NSA for now. What more could I do? It was time to
prod the other agencies.</p>

<p>By late April the Bundespost still hadn't received the proper
papers from the United States. Their traces were based on an official
complaint filed by the University of Bremen.</p>

<p>But although the Bundespost had completed several traces, they
wouldn't tell me the suspects' names or phone numbers. German law
prohibited this. Sounded familiar. Briefly, I wondered if my sister
Jeannie would be willing to snoop around Hannover. She'd been the most
responsive investigator so far.</p>

<p>I phoned Mike Gibbons. "We're no longer handling this as a criminal
case," he said.<a id="p275" name="p275"></a></p>

<p>"Why give up when the Germans have traced the line and know the
suspects, names?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say we were giving up. I just said that the FBI isn't
treating this as a criminal case."</p>

<p>What did that mean? As usual, Mike clammed up when I asked
questions.</p>

<p>Had the Air Force made much progress? They were quietly getting the
word out that reptiles were crawling through the Milnet, trying to
break into military computers. One by one, sites were tightening up
security.</p>

<p>But the Air Force relied on the FBI to catch the hacker. Ann Funk
and Jim Christy wished they could help, but couldn't.</p>

<p>"Tell me anything except, 'It's not my bailiwick,' " I said.</p>

<p>"OK," Ann replied, "it's not within my command."</p>

<h3>48</h3>

<p class="first">I didn't like leaving Berkeley, partly because I
missed my sweetheart, but also because it left the hacker
unwatched.</p>

<p>I was to talk to the NTISSIC, a governmental organization whose
acronym has never been decoded. Bob Morris said they set policy for
telecommunications and information security, so I could guess some of
the letters.</p>

<p>"While you're in the area," Teejay said, "how about stopping by our
headquarters in Langley?"</p>

<p>Me? Visit the CIA? I'm in way over my head now. Meeting the spooks
on their own ground. I could just imagine it: hundreds of spies in
trench coats, skulking around hallways.</p>

<p>Then the NSA invited me to Fort Meade as well. But not quite so
informally. Over the phone, Zeke Hanson said, "We'd like you to
prepare a talk for the X-1 department. They'll send you questions in
advance."</p>

<p>Department X-1 of the National Security Agency? Yow, now this was
cloak-and-dagger. As usual, I couldn't get any<a id="p276"
name="p276"></a> more information out of them . . . Zeke wouldn't even
tell me what X-1 stood for.</p>

<p>Well, I arrived at NSA, and Bob Morris greeted me in his
office. The three chalkboards were covered with Russian writing
("They're rhyming riddles," he explained) and a few mathematical
equations. Where else but at NSA?</p>

<p>I chalked a short note in Chinese, and Bob hit me with an easy
number problem: OTTFFSS. "What's the next letter, Cliff?"</p>

<p>That was an oldie. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. "The
next letter is E for Eight," I announced.</p>

<p>Well, we fooled around with puzzles and palindromes for a while,
until he wrote out this series of numbers: 1, 11, 21, 1211,
111221.</p>

<p>"Complete that series, Cliff."</p>

<p>I looked at it for five minutes and gave up. I'm sure it's easy,
but to this day, I still haven't solved it.</p>

<p>It was weird. Here I was, hoping to light a fire under NSA's
feet. And here was Bob Morris, their top guru, competing with me in
number games. Fun, sure. But disquieting.</p>

<p>We drove down to Washington, to the Department of Justice. We
talked about computer security, and I pointed out to him that, for all
he knew, I could be making up this whole story.</p>

<p>"You don't have a way of checking up on me."</p>

<p>"We don't need to. NSA is a house of mirrors&#8212;each section
checks on another section."</p>

<p>"You mean you spy on yourself?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no. We constantly check our results. For instance, when we
solve a mathematical problem by theoretical means, we check the result
on a computer. Then another section might try to solve the same
problem with a different technique. It's all a matter of
abstraction."</p>

<p>"Think anyone will mind that I don't have a tie?" I'd worn a clean
pair of jeans, figuring there might be some important people. But I
still didn't own a suit or tie.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," Bob said. "At your level of abstraction, it doesn't
make any difference."</p>

<p>The meeting was top secret, so I couldn't listen&#8212;someone
fetched me when my turn came. In a small room, lit only by<a id="p277"
name="p277"></a> the viewgraph machine, there were around thirty
people, most of them in uniforms. Generals and admirals, like you see
in the movies.</p>

<p>Well, I talked for half an hour, describing how the hacker was
breaking into military computers and skipping through our
networks. One general in the back kept interrupting with
questions. Not easy ones, like "When did you discover this guy?" but
toughies, like "How can you prove that electronic mail hasn't been
forged?" and "Why hasn't the FBI solved this case?"</p>

<p>Well, the questions didn't let up for another half hour, when they
finally let me off the rack. Over cheese sandwiches, Bob Morris
explained what had happened.</p>

<p>"I've never seen so many brass in one room before. You know, that
one guy who asked the good questions&#8212;he's one of the junior
people in the room. Just a Major General."</p>

<p>I know as little about the military world as the next person. "I
guess I'm impressed, though I'm not sure why," I said.</p>

<p>"You ought to be," Bob said. "These are all flag officers. General
John Paul Hyde works at the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And that guy in the
front row&#8212;he's a big shot from the FBI. It's a good thing he
heard you."</p>

<p>I wasn't so sure. I could imagine a honcho in the FBI having a
rough time of it: he knows that his agency ought to be doing
something, yet something gets corked up. He didn't need flack from
some Berkeley longhair; he needed our support and cooperation.</p>

<p>I was suddenly queasy. I pressed the replay button in my mind. Did
I screw up? It's a weird feeling of being nervous after you do
something. The more I thought about it, the more impressed I was with
the military people. They'd zeroed in on the weak points of my talk,
and understood both the details and importance of what I'd said.</p>

<p>How far I'd come. A year ago, I would have viewed these officers as
war-mongering puppets of the Wall Street capitalists. This, after all,
was what I'd learned in college. Now things didn't seem so black and
white. They seemed like smart people handling a serious problem.</p>

<p>The next morning I was to speak at NSA's X-1
department.<a id="p278" name="p278"></a> Sure enough, they'd prepared
a list of questions, and asked me to concentrate on the following
themes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. How was the penetrator tracked?</p>

<p>2. What auditing features exist?</p>

<p>3. How to audit someone with system-level privilege?</p>

<p>4. Supply technical details on how to penetrate computers.</p>

<p>5. How were passwords obtained for the Livermore Grays?</p>

<p>6. How were super-user privileges obtained?</p>

<p>7. Did the penetrator guard against detection?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I stared at these questions, and gulped. Oh, I understood what the
NSA folks were asking me, but there was something wrong here.</p>

<p>Was it that the answers to these questions could be used to break
into systems? No, that wasn't my objection. They covered essentially
defensive topics.</p>

<p>Or did I object to NSA's role of gathering information but not
sharing it with anyone else? No, not really. I had resigned myself to
that.</p>

<p>Reading them a third time, I sensed that they showed an underlying
assumption that I found offensive. I scratched my head, wondering what
was annoying me.</p>

<p>Finally I realized what galled me about their questions.</p>

<p>It wasn't the content of the questions, it was their intrinsic
neutrality. They assumed an impersonal adversary&#8212;a sanitized
"penetrator." They implied that this was an emotionless, technical
problem, to be solved by purely technical means.</p>

<p>So long as you think of someone ripping you off as a "penetrator,"
you'll never make any progress. As long as they remained impersonal
and detached, the NSA people would never realize that this wasn't just
a computer being penetrated, but was a community being attacked.</p>

<p>As a scientist, I understood the importance of remaining detached
from an experiment. But I'd never solve the problem until I got
involved; until I worried about the cancer patients who might be
injured by this guy; until I became angry that this hacker was
directly threatening all of us.<a id="p279" name="p279"></a></p>

<p>I rephrased the questions and scribbled a new viewgraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. How does this scoundrel break into computers?</p>

<p>2. Which systems does he slither into?</p>

<p>3. How did this bastard become super-user?</p>

<p>4. How did the louse get passwords to the Livermore Cray?</p>

<p>5. Did the skunk guard against detection?</p>

<p>6. Can you audit a varmint who's system manager?</p>

<p>7. How do you trace an eggsucker back to his roost?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now <em>those</em> questions, I can answer.</p>

<p>These NSA spooks spoke in morally null jargon, while I felt genuine
outrage. Outrage that I was wasting my time following a vandal instead
of doing astrophysics. Outrage that this spy was grabbing sensitive
information with impunity. Outrage that my government didn't give a
damn.</p>

<p>So how do you pump up a bunch of technocrats when you're a
long-haired astronomer without a tie? Or without any security
clearance? (There must be some rule like, "No suit, no shoes, no
clearance.") I did my best, but I'm afraid that the NSA people were
more interested in the technology than any ethical implications.</p>

<p>Afterwards they showed me a few of their computer systems. It was a
bit disconcerting: every room I walked into had a flashing red light
on the ceiling. "It warns everyone not to say anything classified
while you're here," I was told.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of section X-1?" I asked my guide.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's boring," she replied. "NSA has twenty-four divisions,
each with a letter. X is the secure software group. We test secure
computers. X-1 are the mathematical folks who test software
theoretically&#8212;trying to find holes in its design. X-2 people sit
at the computer, trying to break software once it's written."</p>

<p>"So that's why you're interested in computer weaknesses."</p>

<p>"Yeah. One division of NSA may spend three years building a secure
computer. X-1 will examine its design and then X-2 will bang on it,
searching for holes. If we find any, we'll return it, but we won't
tell them where the bug is. We leave it for them to puzzle
out."<a id="p280" name="p280"></a></p>

<p>I wondered if they would have picked up the problem with
Gnu-Emacs.</p>

<p>Along the way, I asked several people at NSA if there was any way
that they could support our work. Individually, they regretted that
our funding came entirely out of physics grants. Collectively, though,
they offered no help.</p>

<p>"It would be easier if you were a defense contractor," one spook
told me. "NSA shies away from academics. There seems to be a kind of
mutual distrust." So far, my total outside support was $85, an
honorarium for speaking at the San Francisco Bay Technical Librarians'
Association.</p>

<p>The tour of NSA lasted well into lunch, so I left Fort Meade late,
and got plenty lost on my way to the CIA in Langley, Virginia. Around
2 p.m., I found the unmarked turnoff and pulled up to the gatehouse,
an hour late.</p>

<p>The guard stared at me like I'd recently arrived from Mars. "Who
are you here to see?"</p>

<p>"Teejay."</p>

<p>"Your last name?"</p>

<p>"Stoll." The guard looked over her clipboard, handed me a form to
fill out, and slipped a blue pass on the rental car's dashboard.</p>

<p>A VIP parking pass from the CIA. That's gotta be worth $5.00 back
in The People's Republic of Berkeley. Maybe $10.00.</p>

<p>Me? A VIP? At the CIA? Surreal. I dodged a few joggers and bicycles
on my way to the VIP lot. An armed guard assured me that I didn't have
to lock the car doors. In the background, the seventeen-year locusts
were buzzing and a mallard quacked. What's a flock of ducks doing at
the portals of the CIA?</p>

<p>Teejay hadn't said how technical a talk he wanted, so I stuffed my
viewgraphs into a grungy envelope. Then, off to the CIA building.</p>

<p>"You're late," Teejay called from across the foyer. What do I tell
him? That I always get lost on freeways?</p>

<p>In the middle of the foyer's floor is a five-foot-diameter seal of
the CIA, a terrazzo eagle set behind an official seal. I expected
everyone to walk around the gray symbol, just as the high school
students do in <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>.<a id="p281"
name="p281"></a> No such luck. Everyone walks on top of it, showing
the poor bird no respect.</p>

<p>On the wall, there's a marble inscription, "The Truth Shall Set You
Free." (I wondered why they'd use Caltech's motto&#8212;then I noticed
the quote came from the Bible.) Four-dozen stars were engraved on the
opposite wall&#8212;I could only guess about the forty-eight lives
they represented.</p>

<p>After a ritualistic search of my belongings, I received a
fluorescent red badge with a V. The visitor tag wasn't
necessary&#8212;I was the only guy around without a tie. Not a trench
coat in sight.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was that of a subdued campus, with people strolling
the hallway, practicing languages, and arguing around
newspapers. Every once in a while, a couple would wander by, arm in
arm. This was a long way from Boris and Natasha cartoons.</p>

<p>Well, not exactly like a campus. As Teejay showed me to his
first-floor office, I noticed that each door was a different color,
but none had cartoons or political posters on them. Some, however, had
combination locks, almost like bank vaults. Even the electrical boxes
had padlocks.</p>

<p>"Because you're late, we've rescheduled the meeting," Teejay
said.</p>

<p>"I've got to select viewgraphs," I said. "How technical a talk
should I give?"</p>

<p>Teejay gave me the hairy eyeball and said, "Don't worry about
it. You won't need viewgraphs."</p>

<p>I sensed trouble ahead. No escaping this time. While sitting around
Teejay's desk, I discovered that he had a fantastic set of rubber
stamps. Real "TOP SECRET" stamps, along with things like "CLASSIFIED,"
"EYES ONLY," "COMPARTMENTALIZED INTELLIGENCE," "SHRED AFTER READING,"
and "NOFORN." I figured the last one meant "No Fornicating," but
Teejay set me straight: "No Foreign Nationals." I stamped each one on
a sheet of paper, and stuffed it in my pack of viewgraphs.</p>

<p>Greg Fennel, the other spook who had visited me in Berkeley,
stopped by and took me up to the CIA's computer room. More like a
stadium. In Berkeley, I was accustomed to a dozen computers in a big
room. Here, there were hundreds of mainframe computers packed
tightly<a id="p282" name="p282"></a> together in a huge cavern. Greg
pointed out that, outside of Fort Meade, it's the world's largest
computer installation.</p>

<p>All IBM mainframes.</p>

<p>Now, among Unix aficionados, big IBM systems are throw-backs to the
1960s, when computing centers were the rage. With desktop
workstations, networks, and personal computers, Goliath centralized
systems seem antiquated.</p>

<p>"Why all this IBM stuff?" I asked Greg. "Those things are
dinosaurs." I snidely showed my Unix bias.</p>

<p>"Well, we're changing," Greg answered. "We've got a dedicated
artificial intelligence group, active robotics researchers, and our
image-processing lab really cooks."</p>

<p>I remembered proudly showing Teejay and Greg through my lab's
computing system. Suddenly, I felt incredibly embarrassed&#8212;our
five Vaxes, scientific workhorses to us, seemed mighty puny next to
these.</p>

<p>Yet our purposes were different. The CIA needs a giant database
system&#8212;they want to organize and associate lots of diverse
data. We needed number crunchers: computers that were fast with
math. It's always tempting to measure the speed of a computer or the
size of its disks, and then conclude that "this one is better."</p>

<p>The question isn't "Which computer is faster," no, not even "Which
is better." Instead, ask "Which is more suitable?" or "Which will get
your job done?"</p>

<p>After touring the CIA's computing division, Teejay and Greg took me
up to the seventh floor. The staircase is labeled with the floor
numbers in different languages: I recognized the fifth floor (Chinese)
and the sixth floor (Russian).</p>

<p>I was shown to an anteroom with a Persian rug on the floor,
Impressionist art on the walls, and a bust of George Washington in the
corner. A real mixed bag. I settled down into a sofa with Greg and
Teejay. Across from us were two other guys, each with a picture
badge. We talked a bit&#8212; one of the guys spoke fluent Chinese;
the other had been a veterinarian before joining the CIA. I wondered
what kind of talk I was expected to give.</p>

<p>The office door swung wide, and a tall, gray-haired man called us
in. "Hi, I'm Hank Mahoney. Welcome in."</p>

<p>So this is the meeting. It turns out that the seventh
floor<a id="p283" name="p283"></a> is the hide-out for the CIA's
high-muckity-mucks. Hank Mahoney's the CIA's deputy director; grinning
nearby was Bill Donneley, the assistant director, and a couple
others.</p>

<p>"You mean that you've heard about this case?"</p>

<p>"We've been following it daily. Of course, this case alone may not
seem like much. But it represents a serious problem for the future. We
appreciate your taking the effort to keep us informed." They presented
me with a certificate of appreciation&#8212;wrapped up like a
diploma.</p>

<p>I didn't know what to say, so I stammered out my thanks and looked
at Teejay, who was chuckling. Afterward, he said, "We wanted to keep
it a surprise."</p>

<p>Surprise? Jeez&#8212;I'd expected to walk into a room of
programmers and give a shoptalk on network security. I glanced at the
certificate. It was signed by William Webster, director of the
CIA.</p>

<p>On my way out, sure enough, the guards searched my stack of
viewgraphs. Halfway down, there was that page of paper with its
telltale stamp, "TOP SECRET." Uh oh.</p>

<p>Red alert&#8212;visitor caught leaving CIA with document stamped
"TOP SECRET"! Nothing else on the page, of course. Five minutes of
explaining and two phone calls later, they let me out. But not without
confiscating the rubber stamp sampler. And a lecture on how "we take
security seriously around here."</p>

<p>I flew back to Berkeley, sitting next to Greg Fennel, who was
flying west for some secret business. Turns out that his background is
astronomy&#8212;he used to run an observatory. We talked a bit about
Space Telescope, the billion-dollar, high-precision instrument that's
soon to be launched.</p>

<p>"With a ninety-four-inch telescope in space, we'll be able to see
phenomenal detail on planets," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Just think what you could do if you pointed it at the earth," Greg
said.</p>

<p>"Why bother? All the interesting things are in the sky. And anyway,
the Space Telescope physically can't point to the earth. Its sensors
will burn out if you try."</p>

<p>"What if someone made such a telescope and pointed it to the
earth. What could you see?"</p>

<p>I fiddled a few numbers in my head. Say, three hundred miles up in
orbit, a ninety-four-inch telescope. The<a id="p284" name="p284"></a>
wavelength of light is about four hundred nanometers. . . . "Oh, you
could easily see detail of a couple feet across. The limit would be
around a couple inches. Not quite good enough to recognize a
face."</p>

<p>Greg smiled and said nothing. It took a while, but it eventually
sunk in: the astronomical Space Telescope wasn't the only big
telescope in orbit. Greg was probably talking about some spy
satellite. The secret KH-11, most likely.</p>

<p>I returned home, wondering if I should tell Martha what happened. I
didn't feel any different&#8212;I'd still rather be doing astronomy
than chasing some hacker&#8212;but I worried that Martha might not
approve of who I'd been rubbing shoulders with.</p>

<p>"Have fun?" she asked when I returned.</p>

<p>"Yeah, in a weird way," I answered. "You don't want to know who I
met."</p>

<p>"Makes no difference. You've been crunched up in an airplane all
day. Let me rub your back."</p>

<p>Home sweet home.</p>

<h3>49</h3>

<p class="first">I still seethed with frustration when I thought of
the eight months that we'd been stuck to this tar baby. My boss
wouldn't let me forget that I was doing nothing useful.</p>

<p>Then on Wednesday, April 22, Mike Gibbons called to say that FBI
Headquarters had decided we should keep monitoring the hacker. It
seems the German police wanted to catch this guy; the only way this
could happen was if we notified the Germans immediately when our
alarms sounded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the FBI had put in an official request for cooperation
and speedy telephone traces. They were talking to the administrator of
justice in Germany, via the U.S. State Department.</p>

<p>Well, yippee. Why this sudden change in policy? Had the NTISSIC
committee made a decision? Or was it due to my constant pestering? Or
had the Germans finally contacted the FBI?<a id="p285"
name="p285"></a></p>

<p>Although the FBI was only now interested, I'd never disabled my
monitoring station. Even when I was away for a couple days, the
monitors remained on guard. Last week's printouts showed him on the
system from 9:03 to 9:04 a.m. on Saturday, April 19. Later that day,
he appeared again for a couple minutes. Quiet for a few days, then he
popped up, checked that the SDINET files were still around, and
left.</p>

<p>For the past month, I'd been leaving new bait for the hacker. He
saw it&#8212;at least he glanced at the names of the files&#8212;but
he didn't read any of it. Was he worried that he was being watched?
Did he know?</p>

<p>But if he thought we were watching him, he'd be a fool to show up
at all. Maybe he couldn't afford longer connections? No, the
Bundespost told us that he was charging these calls to a small company
in Hannover.</p>

<p>Throughout the spring, I kept making new bait. To an outsider, the
bogus SDINET files were the product of a functioning office. My
mythical Barbara Sherwin created memos and letters, requisitions and
travel orders. Here and there she sprinkled a few technical articles,
explaining how the SDI network interconnected all sorts of classified
computers. One or two notes implied that you could use the LBL
computers to link into the network.</p>

<p>Every day, I wasted an hour juggling these SDINET files. My hopes
were to keep the hacker occupied here, rather than going out into
military systems. At the same time, it gave us an opportunity to trace
the hacker.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 27, I'd biked in late and began writing a program
to let our Unix system talk to Macintosh computers on people's desk
tops. If I could connect those together, any of our scientists could
use the Macintosh's printer. A fun project.</p>

<p>By 11:30, I'd fouled up two programs&#8212;what had worked an hour
ago wasn't working now&#8212;when Barbara Schaefer called from five
floors upstairs.</p>

<p>"Hey, Cliff," the astronomer said, "a letter just arrived for
Barbara Sherwin."</p>

<p>"Be serious." For once, it was my turn to say that.</p>

<p>"Really. Come on up and let's open it." I had told Barbara about
the dummy SDINET project and mentioned that I was using her mailbox as
a mail drop. But I never really<a id="p286" name="p286"></a> expected
the hacker to actually send something in the mail.</p>

<p>Good grief! Had this hacker greeted us with a letter?</p>

<p>I ran up the five flights of stairs&#8212;the elevator's too
slow. Barb and I looked at the letter. Addressed to Mrs. Barbara
Sherwin, SDINET project, Mail Stop 50-351, LBL, Berkeley,
CA. Postmarked from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>My heart was thumping from the run up the stairs, but I felt the
adrenaline rush when I saw that envelope.</p>

<p>We carefully slit the envelope and shook out this letter:</p>

<p>Son of a bitch! Someone had swallowed our bait and was asking for
more information! I could understand it if the letter came from
Hannover. But Pittsburgh? What's happening here?</p>

<p>I asked Barb Schaeffer to tell this to nobody and called Mike
Gibbons at the Alexandria FBI office.</p>

<p>"Hey Mike, remember those carrots I left out for bait in
January?"</p>

<p>"You mean those SDI files you concocted?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said. "Well, my dear, sweet, nonexistent secretary just
received a letter."</p>

<p>"Be serious."</p>

<p>"Someone in Pittsburgh wants to learn about SDI."</p>

<p>"And you've got that letter?"</p>

<p>"Right in front of me."</p>

<p>"OK," Mike said. "Listen up carefully. Don't touch that
letter. Especially, don't touch around the edges. Go find a glassine
envelope. Gently insert the paper in the envelope. Then fed-ex it to
me. Whatever you do, don't handle it. Wear gloves if you must."</p>

<p>"Well, the real Barb Schaeffer's already touched it."</p>

<p>"We may have to fingerprint her, then. Oh, before you put it in the
envelope, initial the middle of the back side."</p>

<p>This sounded like Dick Tracy's "Crimestoppers," but I followed
orders. I handled it like an astronomical negative&#8212; except that
I made a photocopy for myself. I suspected that Mike might forget to
return the original.</p>

<p>After I'd chased around for an hour (ever hunt for glassine
envelopes?) and shipped the letter to the FBI, I dug out my
logbook.</p>

<p>The information in that letter showed up in exactly one
of<a id="p288" name="p288"></a> my bogus files. That file,
named <em>form-letter,</em> had been read only once. On Friday,
January 16, the hacker had read that file.</p>

<p>I could prove that nobody else had seen it. I'd protected that
file, <em>form-letter,</em> so nobody could read it except the system
manager. Or someone who'd illegitimately become system manager.</p>

<p>Well, maybe someone else had figured out a way to read that
file. Nope. Whenever the computer touched that file, for any reason,
my alarm sounded and I got a printout. Only one person set off that
alarm. The hacker.</p>

<p>I compared Laszlo Balogh's letter from Pittsburgh with my
fabricated letter of January 16. He'd pretty much asked for everything
that the bait mentioned.</p>

<p>Identical.</p>

<p>Except he'd carefully deleted the word "classified" when asking for
document #65.3.</p>

<p>Several errors jumped out: it's Cyclotron, not Cyclotrov. Berkeley,
not Berkley. I wondered if the writer's native tongue might not be
English&#8212;who would say, "Plans and Implementations of Conference
Notes"?</p>

<p>Strange. Who's behind this?</p>

<p>Oh&#8212;I know what's happening! This hacker lives in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. He calls Hannover, connects to the German telephone
system, and then invades my computer. What a way to hide!</p>

<p>Naw. That one doesn't hold water. Why wouldn't he call
directly&#8212;straight from Pittsburgh to Berkeley?</p>

<p>I reread my logbook of January 18. On that day, we'd traced the
connection all the way back to the hacker's phone in Hannover. That
confirms it. The electronic connection went to someone's home in
Hannover, not Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Information had moved from my computer in Berkeley, across Tymnet,
into Hannover, Germany. Three months later, a letter arrives from
Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>I scratched my head and looked for a phone number on the
letter. None. Maybe Laszlo's listed in the Pittsburgh directory
service? Nope. Triam isn't listed either.</p>

<p>That name, though ... I called my sister Jeannie.</p>

<p>"Hey, sister, what kind of name is Balogh?" Jeannie knows this kind
of thing.<a id="p289" name="p289"></a></p>

<p>"Sounds like Central or Southern Europe. Hungary or Bulgaria. Have
a first name?"</p>

<p>"Laszlo."</p>

<p>"Hungary for sure. Why, I had a boyfriend, once, whose father
..."</p>

<p>"Any chance it's German?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Doesn't sound like it to me."</p>

<p>I told her about the letter and the misspellings. "Substituting
'trov' for 'tron' sounds like a Hungarian error," she said. "I'll bet
on Hungary."</p>

<p>"Ever hear of the name 'Langman?'"</p>

<p>"No, can't say I have. It means long man in German, if that's any
consolation."</p>

<p>"The hacker once created an account for T. G. Langman."</p>

<p>"Sounds like an alias to me," Jeannie said. "And how do you know
this Laszlo character is real? Might well be another pseudonym."</p>

<p>Computer hackers hide behind pseudonyms. In the past seven months,
I'd come across Pengo, Hagbard, Frimp, Zombie ... but T. G. Langman
and Laszlo Balogh? Maybe.</p>

<p>A hacker in Hannover, Germany, learns a secret from Berkeley,
California. Three months later, a Hungarian, living in Pittsburgh,
writes us a letter. Fascinating.</p>

<p>Three months, huh? I thought on this for a while. Suppose two
friends were communicating with each other. News would take a couple
of days to move between them. A week or two, perhaps. But not three
months.</p>

<p>So Laszlo in Pittsburgh probably wasn't a close friend of the
Hannover hacker.</p>

<p>Now suppose that the information was filtered through some third
party. How many people were involved? If two or three people meet,
make a decision, and act, it'll only take a week or two. But if five
or ten people meet, decide, and act, it'll take a month or two.</p>

<p>Yet I'm pretty sure that only one person is operating the
computer. Nobody else would have such a tedious, methodical, and
persistent manner. The German Bundespost says they're following at
least two guys. What's happening here?</p>

<p>Whatever's going on, I'm in over my head. They don't teach you this
kind of stuff in graduate school. Seemed like<a id="p290"
name="p290"></a> the CIA's bailiwick. I called Teejay and got two
sentences into my description.</p>

<p>"Wait a second. Let me call you back on a different line." A
secured phone line.</p>

<p>No doubt, this latest wrinkle hit him where he lived. I had to
explain it to him twice&#8212;he also wanted an express copy of
Laszlo's letter. News travels fast in certain circles: half an hour
later, Greg Fennel of the CIA called, asking if Laszlo might have
logged into my computer. I explained about my alarms and
tripwires. "No, the only guy that's seen that file is a hacker in
Hannover."</p>

<p>Greg was quiet on the phone for a second, then said, "A real
smoking gun."</p>

<p>That reminded me of the NSA guy's comment. Time to call Bob
Morris. I told him about the letter and he seemed mildly
interested. "Want me to send you a copy by Federal Express?"</p>

<p>"That won't be necessary. First class is good enough."</p>

<p>He seemed more interested in my techniques of setting alarms than
the content of the letter. In a way, that's not surprising&#8212;he'd
already concluded that something serious was happening.</p>

<p>Air Force OSI sent an investigator over to examine the
letter. Their man, Steve Shumaker, had the common sense to show up in
dungarees and a T-shirt, so as not to alarm the natives. He asked for
a copy of the letter and the printouts from the Air Force System
Command Space Division. They were going to do a postmortem analysis of
the hacker's break-in.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a copy of the letter&#8212;that's no problem," I
told Shumaker, "but I can't let you have the original printouts. The
FBI's warned me to keep all of this locked up since it might be used
as evidence."</p>

<p>"Can you Xerox it?"</p>

<p>Aargh. Xerox five hundred pages of computer printout?</p>

<p>Well, we spent an hour in front of the copier, feeding the damned
paper through the machine. I asked the OSI detective what he thought
of the letter from Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>"We've been warning everyone that this was bound to happen. Maybe
they'll wake up now."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing so far?"<a id="p291" name="p291"></a></p>

<p>"We visit sites and try to raise their security awareness," he
said. "We've formed a team to test their computer security by trying
to break into Air Force systems. What we found isn't encouraging."</p>

<p>"You mean you're the only ones who test Air Force computers for
security?" I asked. "You must have thousands of computers."</p>

<p>"Well, there's also a group in San Antonio, the Air Force
Electronic Security Command, that searches for electronic security
breaches," Shumaker said. "They mostly worry about communications
security&#8212;you know, keeping radio transmissions secret. They're
sharpies over there, all right."</p>

<p>Gibbons of the FBI was a sharpie, too. Finally, now that he was
actively committed, he wanted to know everything. Every time the
hacker appeared, Mike wanted to know about it immediately. Throughout
the day, he called repeatedly, asking for my logs and notes, floppy
disks and printouts. Descriptions of the monitors. Everything. That's
the way to make progress.</p>

<p>I couldn't get this letter out of my mind. I kept searching for
some innocent explanation, some way that it might be written off as a
fluke.</p>

<p>Finally I gave up and admitted victory. I couldn't explain it any
other way: the letter must mean my plan had worked. No, not my plan,
it was Claudia's. My sweet, guileless roommate, who didn't know a
computer from a toaster, had trapped this cunning hacker!</p>

<p>Cycling home, I swerved suddenly from my usual route, scooted into
the Double-Rainbow ice cream store and the video rental place. Then I
hurried home, waving a copy of Laszlo's letter. Elated at the news,
Martha and Claudia cackled evilly and dropped into Boris and Natasha
accents. Zecret plan 35B vas a success!</p>

<p>We crowded into Claudia's room, munched out on popcorn and ice
cream, and cheered the monsters in <em>Godzilla Versus Monster
Zero.</em><a id="p292" name="p292"></a></p>

<h3>50</h3>

<p class="first">"Don't say anything to anyone!"</p>

<p>It was Mike Gibbons on the phone, telling me not to spread the word
to the CIA.</p>

<p>"Uh, I'm sorry, Mike, but I've already told this guy Teejay." I
wondered if Mike had heard of Teejay.</p>

<p>"I'll take care of it, then. This letter you sent us is
intriguing. We ran it through some lab tests."</p>

<p>"What'd you learn?" Mike was being more communicative than usual,
so I might as well push my luck.</p>

<p>"Can't tell you, but we're not treating this case lightly. Aspects
of it are quite, well, intriguing." That's the second time Mike used
that word. Something's up. "Oh, by the way, could you send me a
half-dozen sheets of your letterhead?"</p>

<p>The FBI wants my lab's letterhead? Sounds like they're going to
reply to Laszlo's letter.</p>

<p>What would "I" tell this guy? How about,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. Balogh:</p>

<p>You have been selected as a grand prize winner in the SDINET
sweepstakes. . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hacker played hide-and-seek for the next few days. He'd show up
for three minutes, look at our password file, then log out. My bait
grew tastier every day. Yet he wasn't nibbling.</p>

<p>Monday morning, May 18, he came into our system at 6:54
a.m. Awakened by an insistent beep, I reached over and whapped the
alarm clock. Wrong noisemaker&#8212;the beep continued. Three beeps. S
for Sventek. It's the hacker, over on the Unix-4 computer.</p>

<p>Mechanically I ran to my Macintosh, switched it on, and called
Steve White at Tymnet.</p>

<p>"Steve, someone's tripped my alarm," I said, still a bit hazy. "I
haven't checked it out yet, but could you start the
trace?"<a id="p293" name="p293"></a></p>

<p>"Right-o. It'll be up in ten seconds," he said. "Here it is. Coming
through the Westar satellite. Calling address 2624 DNIC
5421-0421. That's Bremen. I'll ring the Bundespost."</p>

<p>I copied down the number; by now my home computer was warmed
up. Steve had just completed an international trace in less than a
minute. I dialed my lab's system from my pipsqueak home computer and
examined the Unix-4 computer. There was Sventek, just leaving.</p>

<p>He'd been on for four minutes. Long enough to detect him and
complete a trace. Long enough to ruin my morning. I wouldn't be able
to get back to sleep, so I biked up to the lab. Over in the east, the
morning star kept me company. Venus.</p>

<p>In four minutes this hacker had pried at a new part of my operating
system. He searched for a program called X-preserve on our Unix
computer.</p>

<p>Hey&#8212;I know what he's doing. He's looking for the X-preserve
hole in the VI-editor. Dave Cleveland and I had patched that almost a
year ago. But this hacker is only now trying to exploit it.</p>

<p>VI is the Unix screen editor. When Bill Joy wrote it, back in 1980,
people thought it was the neatest invention around. It let you watch
as you moved words around! If you wanted to remove a word in the
middle of a paragraph, you just moved the blinking box to that word,
and presto!</p>

<p>VI was predecessor to hundreds of word processing systems. By now,
Unix folks see it as a bit stodgy&#8212;it hasn't the versatility of
Gnu-Emacs, nor the friendliness of more modern editors. Despite that,
VI shows up on every Unix system.</p>

<p>What happens if you're writing a long article and the computer
hiccups? Say, there's a power blackout or some moron pulls the
plug. Used to be that you'd lose everything you had typed in.</p>

<p>The VI editor uses X-preserve to recover what you've done. When the
computer returns from the dead, X-preserve will reassemble the pieces
of your work. It'll then ask you where to store this knit-together
file. Most people will say, "Oh, put it in my home directory."</p>

<p>But X-preserve didn't check where you stashed that file. You could
say, "Stick the file in the systems directory," and it would do
so.<a id="p294" name="p294"></a> That's what the hacker tried. He made
a file that said, "Grant system privilege to Sventek." He fired up the
VI-editor, then tripped up the editor by feeding it an interrupt
character. VI, sensing a problem, stored his file in pieces.</p>

<p>The hacker's next step? Tell X-preserve to slip that file into the
systems directory. In a couple minutes, Unix would hatch it, and he'd
become system manager.</p>

<p>But the cuckoo's egg fell out of this nest. We'd fixed the
X-preserve program ... it now checks who you are and won't let you
move a file into the systems area.</p>

<p>Poor guy. He must feel crestfallen. A nifty trick to break into
systems, but it just won't work here in Berkeley.</p>

<p>Oh, I'd left our other holes open. He can still use Gnu-Emacs to
plant his egg-program in the systems nest. And I've purposely left two
other holes in our system waiting around for him to discover. Just to
measure his skill. So far, he's batting one for three.</p>

<p>All this took three minutes. He entered his program
perfectly&#8212;not a single typing error. It's as if he'd done this
often. As if he'd practiced breaking into other computers.</p>

<p>How many other system managers hadn't yet patched X-preserve? How
many other holes were still waiting to be discovered? Where would I go
to warn people about this? How would I tell the people in the white
hats, without tipping off the bad guys?</p>

<p>Too late for that. The guys in the black hats already know.</p>

<p>Although this connection lasted only a few minutes in Berkeley, the
University of Bremen reported that he was connected for forty-five
minutes. In turn, the Bundespost once again traced the entire link
back to the same individual in Hannover.</p>

<p>Turned out that the University of Bremen was also printing the
hacker's traffic. Two of us were now watching this guy. He could run,
but he couldn't hide.</p>

<p>For the past couple months, he'd just nibbled at the SDINET
files. He'd seen the names of these files and noticed that everyday I
added new memos and letters but didn't read them right off. I'd begun
having my doubts whether he was still interested in our creative
writing.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, May 20, my doubts cleared up. He<a id="p295"
name="p295"></a> connected at five in the morning and dumped all the
SDINET files. Here was one letter asking the Pentagon for more
funding. Another talking about "over-the-horizon radar"&#8212;a catch
phrase I'd found in an electronics magazine. Yet another note
described tests of a new supercomputer, complete with parallel
processors. I tried to conceal my utter lack of knowledge of these
subjects by filling the letters with jargon.</p>

<p>He swallowed them, all right. One by one. I wanted him to ask for
each bogus memo by name rather than saying, "Give me all the files."
So I added a few ringers. Files that were far too long to type out. A
few short files that were filled with gibberish&#8212;computer
guacamole. He couldn't print these poisoned files, so he'd have to
check each file first. This slowed him down and he stayed on the
system longer: more time to trace.</p>

<p>Nine months? We'd been watching this one skunk for the better part
of a year. And Mitre's telephone bills said he'd been breaking in for
more than a year. What persistence!</p>

<p>I wondered again, what's driving this guy? Sure, I'd get a charge
out of fooling around for a night or two. Might even be fun for a
couple weeks. But a year? Night after night, patiently twisting
doorknobs to computers? Why, you'd have to pay me.</p>

<p>Paid? Was someone paying this hacker?</p>

<p>The next few times he showed up, I hadn't added much more to his
SDINET feeding grounds. My puppet secretary, Barbara Sherwin, wrote a
word-processed memo asking for a week's vacation. The hacker read this
and should have understood why there was so little new
information.</p>

<p>Instead of pawing through LBL's files, then, he went out over the
Milnet, once again patiently trying to guess passwords. One of my
bogus SDINET reports mentioned a special project at White Sands
Missile Range; sure enough, he spent fifteen minutes scratching at
their door. White Sands' computers recorded a dozen attempts to break
in, but none were successful.</p>

<p>Chris McDonald, White Sands' computer security ace, called me
within the hour. "Someone's setting off alarms inside my WSMR05
computer."</p>

<p>"I know. It's the same hacker."<a id="p296" name="p296"></a></p>

<p>"Well, he's trying accounts that don't exist. Names like
SDINET. There's no way he'll get in that way," Chris said
confidently. "Anyway, that machine needs two passwords, and we changed
'em all last week." White Sands didn't fool around.</p>

<p>He wasted his time trying thirty other computers as well. The
Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The Army Safety
Center at Fort Rucker. Strategic Air Command. The Defense Nuclear
Agency at Kirtland Air Force Base. Though he still tried account names
like "guest" and "system," he used "SDINET" as well. No doubt that
he's a believer.</p>

<p>Mostly the hacker's trips through my system were becoming
routine. I still ran to the switchyard whenever my beeper called, but
I guess I'd become accustomed to having this mouse in a cage.</p>

<p>I'd waited eight months, I could wait some more. Around the second
week of June, he stopped into my computer from 3:38 until 4:13 in the
afternoon. We traced him completely&#8212;Hannover again&#8212;and
stayed in touch with the FBI throughout.</p>

<p>Immediately after logging onto my Berkeley computer, he jumped onto
the Mil net and tried to log onto some computers at the Unisys
Corporation, in Paoli, Pennsylvania. Systems named "Omega," "Bigburd,"
and "Rosencrantz" (I kept waiting to see Guildenstern, but he never
found it). Then he tried the Unisys Burdvax system.</p>

<p>He got in on his first try. Account name Ingres, password,
"Ingres." Not bad ... he remembers the Ingres database. But why did he
just try those Unisys computers? What brought them to his attention?
Maybe someone told him to look for them.</p>

<p>Maybe Laszlo Balogh in Pittsburgh worked in Paoli. The atlas said
otherwise. Paoli's a suburb of Philadelphia, hundreds of miles away
from Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>As an Ingres user, the hacker only had limited privileges, but he
took what he could find. Most useful to him, he found a way to read
the Unisys password file. Copied the whole thing to his home
computer. Then he listed several files which should never be
world-readable: the list of phone<a id="p297" name="p297"></a> numbers
that the Unisys computer knew, and Unisys's network address file.</p>

<p>I already knew what he'd do with the Unisys password file. He'd
decrypt it by blasting a dictionary at it. Then he'd log into a more
privileged account and garner still more power.</p>

<p>Those other files were just as worrisome. They provided the hacker
with phone numbers to nearby computers and a map of the Unisys local
network. Now he knew how to connect from the Burdvax into other
computers ... he didn't need to explore.</p>

<p>But even as I watched, he disconnected. Was he scared? No, just
patient. He was going to check up on other computers. First, the Fort
Buckner system in Okinawa. Yes, his password was still good
there. Despite our warnings, they hadn't changed a thing.</p>

<p>Next, he tried the Naval Coastal Systems Command in Panama City,
Florida. But he couldn't get in on his old Ingres account. They'd
changed the password on him.</p>

<p>Didn't faze him for an instant. He turned around and logged in as
user "Ovca," password, "Baseball." This worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Aha! More evidence for password cracking. Two months ago, the
hacker logged into that naval computer as "Ingres," and copied their
encrypted password file. Now, even though they deleted the Ingres
account, he can still log in, using some other account. The fools had
only changed one password. And their passwords were ordinary English
words. Jeez.</p>

<p>While he was at it, he checked into his old haunts. Ramstein Air
Force Base. Fort Stewart. University of Rochester. The Pentagon
Optimis Data Center. Finally he left the network.</p>

<p>Today he'd broken into a new computer at Unisys. Where had I heard
that name? Of course&#8212;they're a defense contractor that makes
computers for the military. Not just any computers. Unisys builds
secure computers, systems that you can't break into.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Wait a second. What other defense contractors had been hit? I
scribbled a list on a pad of paper:<a id="p298" name="p298"></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unisys. Makers of secure computers.</p>

<p>TRW. They make military and space computers.</p>

<p>SRI. They've got military contracts to design computer security
systems.</p>

<p>Mitre. They design high-security computers for the
military. They're the people that test NSA's secure computers.</p>

<p>BBN. The builders of the Milnet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's wrong with this picture? These are the very people that are
designing, building, and testing secure systems. Yet hackers traipse
freely through their computers.</p>

<p>These companies don't have dinky budgets, either. They charge our
government tens of millions of dollars to develop secure software. No
doubt about it: the shoemakers' kids are running around barefoot.</p>

<p>I'd seen this guy break into military computers, defense
contractors, universities, and laboratories. But no banks. Oh&#8212;I
know why. Their networks aren't as public as the Arpanet. But if he
got on their networks, I'd bet he'd be about as successful.</p>

<p>For it doesn't take brilliance or wizardry to break into
computers. Just patience. What this hacker lacked in originality, he
made up for in persistence. A few of the holes he exploited were news
to me: the Gnu-Emacs problem, for instance. But mostly, he took
advantage of administrators' blunders. Leaving accounts protected by
obvious passwords. Mailing passwords to each other. Not monitoring
audit trails.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, was it foolish to remain open? It had been
almost ten months, and he was still free. Despite his breaking into
more than thirty computers, despite Laszlo's letter from Pittsburgh,
despite all these traces, this hacker was still at large. How much
longer would this go on?<a id="p299" name="p299"></a></p>

<h3>51</h3>

<p class="first">It was June&#8212;summer in paradise. I hiked home,
enjoying the scene, Berkeley students with Frisbees, sailboards, and
an occasional convertible top down in the balmy air. Our garden was
full of roses, marigolds, and tomatoes. The strawberries were
thriving, promising still more milkshakes.</p>

<p>Inside the house, however, Martha was imprisoned, studying for her
bar exam. This last ordeal looked even harder than three years of law
school. In summer, when everyone else can go out and play, you're
stuck in dreary review classes, cramming your head with legal rules,
counting the days until the exam&#8212;a three-day ordeal modeled on
the Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>Martha coped, patiently reading her books, making intricate
outlines of each subject with colored pens, meeting with fellow
sufferers to quiz each other. She was philosophical about it; she put
in exactly ten hours each day, then slammed the books shut. Aikido
became her salvation&#8212;she took out her frustrations by flipping
people over her head.</p>

<p>Martha rarely talked about the lurking horror of the exam itself,
but it was always there. Watching her go through this brought back
memories of my own grad school days.</p>

<p>In astronomy, you first enjoy three or four years of confusing
classes, impossible problem sets, and sneers from the faculty. Having
endured that, you're rewarded with an eight-hour written exam, with
questions like: "How do you age-date meteorites using the elements
Samarium and Neodymium?" If you survive, you win the great honor and
pleasure of an oral exam by a panel of learned professors.</p>

<p>I remember it vividly. Across a table, five profs. I'm frightened,
trying to look casual as sweat drips down my face. But I'm keeping
afloat; I've managed to babble superficially, giving the illusion that
I know something. Just a few more questions, I think, and they'll set
me free. Then the examiner over at the end of the table&#8212;the guy
with the twisted little smile&#8212;starts sharpening his pencil with
a penknife.<a id="p300" name="p300"></a></p>

<p>"I've got just one question, Cliff," he says, carving his way
through the Eberhard-Faber. "Why is the sky blue?"</p>

<p>My mind is absolutely, profoundly blank. I have no idea. I look out
the window at the sky with the primitive, uncomprehending wonder of a
Neanderthal contemplating fire. I force myself to say
something&#8212;anything. "Scattered light," I reply. "Uh, yeah,
scattered sunlight."</p>

<p>"Could you be more specific?"</p>

<p>Well, words came from somewhere, out of some deep instinct of
self-preservation. I babbled about the spectrum of sunlight, the upper
atmosphere, and how light interacts with molecules of air.</p>

<p>"Could you be more specific?"</p>

<p>I'm describing how air molecules have dipole moments, the
wave-particle duality of light, scribbling equations on the
blackboard, and . . .</p>

<p>"Could you be more specific?"</p>

<p>An hour later, I'm sweating hard. His simple question&#8212;a
five-year-old's question&#8212;has drawn together oscillator theory,
electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, even quantum
mechanics. Even in my miserable writhing, I admired the guy.</p>

<p>So Sunday morning I'm looking at Martha, calmly working on an
outline, the dining table strewn with books. She'll pass, all right,
but I also know how scared she is and how an exam can make anyone feel
absolutely stupid and helpless. I can't make her ordeal easier, but I
can at least make breakfast. I slip quietly into the kitchen and crack
a few eggs . . .</p>

<p>At 9:32, the damned hacker steps on my tripwire. The pager beeps. I
call Steve White. He calls Germany. Like the old double play: Tinker
to Evers to Chance.</p>

<p>Steve needed a minute to find the hacker coming from address 2624
DNIC 4511 0199-36. Direct from Hannover. (Or as direct as
transatlantic satellite connections can be.)</p>

<p>The Bundespost was hot. Took them only a few minutes to confirm
that they'd started a trace. Nice. Meanwhile, having started the ball
rolling, I pulled on some clothes and biked up to the lab. No time for
yard sales this morning.</p>

<p>I arrived with plenty of time to spare. My visitor was still pawing
through the bogus SDINET files, carefully copying<a id="p301"
name="p301"></a> each one into his own computer. One file described
how the Strategic Defense Initiative was to be used in tracking
satellites in space. Another file seemed to say that you could connect
directly into several Air Force computers from my laboratory.</p>

<p>The hacker wanted to try, but couldn't figure out where we'd
installed the network software. So he scoured our entire computer,
searching for any program containing the phrase "SDI." He found quite
a few, but none seemed to do the job for him.</p>

<p>Then he rifled Dave Cleveland's mail. Dave had prepared for
this&#8212;he'd written a letter talking about how he'd hidden the
SDINET access ports. Dave's letter contained the sentence, "I've
concealed the SDI network port, and I doubt that many people will
discover it."</p>

<p>That was enough to set the hacker on an hour-long wild-goose
chase. He combed through our system, groping for what he knew was a
hidden program that would be his northwestern passage to military
computers everywhere.</p>

<p>I sat back, smiling at the screen. He'd been suckered in, all
right. He still felt challenged to uncover the SDI network connection
and truly believed that he could reach those classified computers.</p>

<p>Yet my system looked vanilla. Because it was vanilla. Oh, here and
there, I sprinkled hints that other people were using the SDI
network. One physicist cooperated and sent a complaint to the system
manager, saying that the SDI network wasn't functioning last Tuesday
night. Another wrote a mundane program full of subroutines with names
like SDI-link and Copy-SDI.</p>

<p>Though it took hours, the hacker eventually discovered these, and
must have scratched his head, wondering why others had such an easy
time using the network. He tried logging into computers
named <em>Sdi</em> and <em>Sdinetwork.</em> Over and over, he sifted
through our system, but to no avail.</p>

<p>Eventually he gave up and let me go home. Martha wasn't pleased, of
course. She'd been studying all morning, and she was hungry and
grouchy. The two eggs stared at me from the pan, uncooked, just as I'd
left them.</p>

<p>So I made a brunch of omelets, hot cocoa, and fruit salad; she
dumped her books off the table with a<a id="p302" name="p302"></a>
vengeance, and we sat down, enjoying a few moments of peace in the
quiet, sunny room. The more strange life gets, the more precious those
times are, with food and friends and the Sunday <em>Times</em>
crossword puzzle.</p>

<p>Monday morning, Teresa Brecken, the Petvax system manager, reported
that someone had attacked her computer. He couldn't get into it but
had been probing it, searching for weak places. His pounding had set
off alarms, and Teresa called me.</p>

<p>He'd come in over her port to the High Energy Physics Network. That
didn't mean much&#8212;there's a couple thousand other computers on
that net. Moreover, the Hepnet ties to SPAN, the Space Physics
Applications Network, run by NASA. Altogether there's well over ten
thousand computers on those networks.</p>

<p>Had the hacker been laughing at me all the time? While I'd been
watching the Tymnet mouse hole, had he been waltzing in through some
NASA network?</p>

<p>Teresa's monitors showed the hacker had come from computer 6.133,
the National Severe Storms Data Center's computer at NASA's Goddard
Spaceflight Center. Not much to do but call them.</p>

<p>I didn't get very far. They were worried about hackers on their
computer and had discovered one or two problems, but couldn't go much
further. I pestered them, and they finally said that this particular
connection had originated at NASA's Marshall Spaceflight Center in
Huntsville, Alabama. From there, who knows? Marshall didn't keep
records.</p>

<p>Same guy? I doubted it. The NASA computers aren't secret&#8212;NASA
does civilian space research and has nothing to do with the Strategic
Defense Initiative. Still, worth remembering the incident: I wrote it
down in my logbook.</p>

<p>I called Mike Gibbons again, wondering how much longer we'd have to
wait before the FBI and their German partners began to move.</p>

<p>"Any day now," Mike replied. "The warrants are in order and we're
just waiting for the right time."</p>

<p>"Give me a figure, Mike. Do you mean hours, days, weeks, or
months?"</p>

<p>"More than days, less than weeks."</p>

<p>I wondered if the FBI was feeding some false
information<a id="p303" name="p303"></a> through Laszlo Balogh. "Ever
reply to the Pittsburgh letter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Hey, how about them Yankees winning another game?" As usual, Mike
played his cards close to his chest.</p>

<p>Almost every day now, the hacker logged in for a few
minutes. Sometimes he'd grab any new files from the SDINET
account. Other days he'd try to break into military computers. Once he
spent half an hour trying to guess the password for our Elxsi
computer&#8212;I'd dropped a hint that our Elxsi was a central SDINET
controller.</p>

<p>I could embroider fake military documents as fast as he could read
them. Knowing that he was passing my handiwork to some agent in
Pittsburgh, I added just a dash of verifiable information: the
Pentagon was scheduling a secret satellite to be launched on
the <em>Atlantis</em> space shuttle. This was common knowledge to
anyone reading the newspapers. But I imagined that in his quest for
secret information, he'd feel that these nuggets of truth confirmed
that he'd struck the mother lode.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 21, 1987, at 12:37 P.M., he logged into our Unix
computer as Sventek. For five minutes he checked the system status and
listed a few mail files. This intrusion seemed just like his
others.</p>

<p>But this session was different in one important way.</p>

<p>It was his last.</p>

<h3>52</h3>

<p class="first">"Hi, Cliff, it's Steve.&#8221; I put down my
chocolate chip cookie.</p>

<p>"I just got a message from Wolfgang Hoffman at the German
Bundespost. He says that there'll be a full-time policeman outside the
hacker's apartment on Monday through Wednesday of next week. They'll
keep watch continually, and they'll rush in to make an arrest as soon
as he connects to Berkeley."</p>

<p>"How will the cop know when to bust in?"</p>

<p>"You'll give the signal, Cliff."</p>

<p>The next time the hacker touched my system, I would<a id="p304"
name="p304"></a> call the FBI and Tymnet. They'd make the trace, tell
the German BKA, and the cops would bust into his apartment.</p>

<p>Finally, after ten months.</p>

<p>Will he show up? And what if he doesn't? Will they bust him anyway
or give up on the whole thing? With my luck, they'll drop the whole
thing.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend at home with Martha, arriving at the lab late
Sunday evening. With the best of luck, the hacker would show up on
Sventek's account, I'd call the FBI, and while he was dumping a file
of my concocted SDI baloney, he'd be busted. I could imagine him
frantically trying to conceal his computer as police break down his
apartment's door.</p>

<p>With dreams like those, I nestled under my desk, wrapped in the
quilt that Martha and I had made last winter. In case my beeper
failed, two personal computers stood watch, each wired to a
bell. After ten months, I wasn't going to miss my big chance.</p>

<p>Monday afternoon, June 22, Wolfgang Hoffman cabled this message:
"Arrests expected shortly. Notify us immediately if hacker shows
up."</p>

<p>OK, I'm waiting. Every few minutes, I walk over to the switchyard
and everything's quiet. Oh yeah, a couple physicists are using Tymnet
to analyze some high-temperature superconductors. But there's no other
traffic. My alarms and tripwires are in place, but not a peep.</p>

<p>Another night under the desk.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning, June 23, Mike Gibbons called from the FBI.</p>

<p>"You can close up shop, Cliff."</p>

<p>"What's happened?"</p>

<p>"Arrest warrants were issued this morning at 10 A.M."</p>

<p>"But I didn't see anyone on my system then."</p>

<p>"Makes no difference."</p>

<p>"Anyone arrested?"</p>

<p>"I can't say."</p>

<p>"Where are you, Mike?"</p>

<p>"In Pittsburgh."</p>

<p>Something was happening. But Mike wouldn't say what. I'd wait for a
while before closing my doors to this hacker.</p>

<p>A few hours later, Wolfgang Hoffman sent a message:<a id="p305"
name="p305"></a> "An apartment and a company were searched, and nobody
was home at the time. Printouts, disks, and tapes were seized and will
be analyzed in the next few days. Expect no further break-ins."</p>

<p>What does this mean? I guess the police busted his apartment. Why
didn't they wait for our signal? Should I celebrate?</p>

<p>Whatever happened, at last we could seal our doors. I changed our
Tymnet passwords and patched the hole in the Gnu-Emacs editor. What
should we do about everyone's passwords?</p>

<p>The only way to guarantee a clean system would be to change every
single password overnight. Then certify each user, one by one, the
next morning. Easy if there's only a few people on your
system. Impossible for our twelve hundred scientists.</p>

<p>Yet if we didn't change every password, we couldn't be sure that
some other hacker might not have purloined an account. All it takes is
one stolen account. In the end we expired everyone's passwords and
asked everyone to pick a new one. One that's not in the
dictionary.</p>

<p>I set traps on all the hacker's stolen accounts. If anyone tries to
log in as Sventek, the system will reject the try&#8212;but it'll
capture all the information on where the call originates. Just let him
try.</p>

<p>Martha and I couldn't celebrate in a big way&#8212;her bar-exam
cram course was a ball and chain&#8212;but we played hooky for a day
and escaped to the North Coast. We wandered on the high cliffs covered
with wildflowers and watched the waves crash over the rocks a hundred
feet below us. We climbed down to an isolated little cove&#8212;our
own private beach&#8212;and for a few hours all my worries were far
away, unreal.</p>

<p>Within the next few days, word filtered back from
Germany. Apparently the Hannover police had simultaneously searched an
office at a small computer company in Hannover, and the apartment of
one of their employees. They seized eighty disks at the computer firm,
and twice that at the apartment. The evidence? Shipped to somewhere
called Wiesbaden for "analysis by experts." Hell, I could analyze it
easily enough myself. Just search for the word "SDINET."<a id="p306"
name="p306"></a> As the inventor of that word, I could tell instantly
whether their printouts were the real McCoy.</p>

<p>What's the hacker's name? What was he up to? What's the connection
with Pittsburgh? What's happened to him? Time to ask Mike of the
FBI.</p>

<p>"Now that it's all over, can you tell me the guy's name?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"It's not all over, and no, I can't tell you his name," Mike
replied, showing more than his usual annoyance at my questions.</p>

<p>"Well, can I find out more about this guy from the Germans?" I knew
the prosecutor's name, even if I didn't know the hacker's.</p>

<p>"Don't contact the Germans. This is sensitive, and you'll bollix
things up."</p>

<p>"Can't you even tell me if the hacker's in jail? Or is he wandering
the streets of Hannover?"</p>

<p>"It's not for me to say."</p>

<p>"Then when will I find out what happened?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you at the right time. Meanwhile, keep all your
printouts locked up."</p>

<p>Lock up the printouts? I looked across my office. Sandwiched
between bookshelves of computer manuals and astronomy books were three
boxes of the hacker's printouts. My office door doesn't have a lock,
and the building is open twenty-four hours a day. Oh&#8212;the
janitor's closet can be locked. I could stash the boxes up over the
sink, on the shelf next to the ceiling.</p>

<p>While he was still on the phone, I asked Mike when I could expect
to hear back on this case.</p>

<p>"Oh, in a few weeks. The hacker will be indicted and brought to
trial," Mike said. "Meanwhile, keep silent about this. Don't publicize
it and stay away from reporters."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Any publicity may let him off. The case is tough enough without
being tried in the newspapers."</p>

<p>"But surely this is an open-and-shut case," I protested. "The
U.S. Attorney said that we had more than enough evidence to convict
the guy."</p>

<p>"Look, you don't know everything that's going on," Mike said. "Take
my word for it: don't talk about it."<a id="p307" name="p307"></a></p>

<p>The FBI was happy with their work, as well they should be. Despite
several false starts, Mike had stuck with the investigation. The FBI
wouldn't let him tell me anything; there wasn't much I could do about
that. But he couldn't stop me from checking on my own.</p>

<p>Ten months ago, Luis Alvarez and Jerry Nelson had told me to treat
the hacker as a research problem. Well, at last the investigation was
complete. Oh, there were a few details to figure out, but the real
work was over. Yet the FBI wouldn't let me publish what I'd
learned.</p>

<p>When you run an experiment, you take notes, think for a while, then
publish your results. If you don't publish, nobody will learn from
your experience. The whole idea is to save others from repeating what
you've done.</p>

<p>It was time for a change anyway. I spent the rest of the summer
making weird computer pictures of telescopes and teaching a few
classes at the computer center. The pursuit of the German had taught
me about how to connect computers together.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, the FBI would let me publish. And when it did, I'd
be ready. Around the beginning of September, I started writing a dry,
scientific paper about the hacker. I just distilled my lab
notebook&#8212;all 125 pages of it&#8212;into a boring article and got
it ready for some obscure computer journal.</p>

<p>Still, letting go of the hacker project wasn't entirely easy. For a
year, the chase had consumed my life. In the course of my quest, I'd
written dozens of programs, forsaken the company of my sweetheart,
mingled with the FBI, NSA, OSI, and CIA, nuked my sneakers, pilfered
printers, and made several coast-to-coast flights. I pondered how I
would now spend my time, now that my life wasn't scheduled around the
whims of some faceless foe from overseas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, six thousand miles away, someone was wishing that he'd
never heard of Berkeley.<a id="p308" name="p308"></a></p>

<h3>53</h3>

<p class="first">A month before the Hannover hacker was caught, Darren
Griffith had joined our group, having moved up from Southern
California. Darren liked punk music, Unix networks, laser typography,
and friends with spiked haircuts&#8212;in that order. Besides the
coffeehouses and concerts, Berkeley attracted him because of its
hundreds of Unix computers tied together with an ethernet, making an
intricate maze for Darren to explore.</p>

<p>At work, our boss set him loose to work in his own rhythm and at
whatever projects interested him. After five, when the normal folks
left, he cranked up the stereo in his cubicle, and wrote programs to
the sound of U2. "The louder the music, the better the code."</p>

<p>I filled him in on the past year's hack and figured that he'd be
delighted with the hole in Gnu-Emacs, but he just shrugged. "Eeh,
anyone could see how to exploit that. Anyway, it's only on a few
hundred systems. Now if you want a tasty security hole, check out
VMS. They've got a hole you could drive a truck through."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. It's in every Vax computer from Digital Equipment
Corporation that runs the VMS operating system Version 4.5."</p>

<p>"What's the problem?"</p>

<p>Darren explained. "Anyone that logs into the system can become
system manager by running a short program. You can't stop "em."</p>

<p>I hadn't heard of this problem. "Isn't DEC doing something about
it? After all, they sell those systems."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, they're sending out patches. But they're being real
quiet about it. They don't want their customers to panic."</p>

<p>"Sounds reasonable."</p>

<p>"Sure, but nobody's installing those patches. What would you
do&#8212;some tape shows up in the mail saying, 'Please<a id="p309"
name="p309"></a> install this program or your system may develop
problems' . . . you'll ignore it, because you've got better things to
do."</p>

<p>"So all these systems are open to attack?"</p>

<p>"You got it."</p>

<p>"Wait a second. That operating system was certified by NSA. They
tested it and certified it secure."</p>

<p>"Sure they spent a year testing it. And a month after they verified
the system, DEC modified it slightly. Just a little change in the
password program." The National Computer Security Center's
verification program had a hole in it as well.</p>

<p>"And now fifty thousand computers are insecure." I couldn't believe
it. If my hacker knew, he'd have a field day. Good thing we'd nailed
him.</p>

<p>This problem seemed important, so I called Bob Morris at the
National Computer Security Center. He'd not heard of it before, but he
promised to check into it. Well, I'd done my job and warned the
authorities.</p>

<p>Around the end of July, Barren picked up a message from the
network. Roy Omond, a system manager in Heidelberg, Germany, had
detected a group called Chaos Computer Club breaking into his Vax
computer. They'd used the hole that Darren had described. Omond's
message described how these vandals had broken in, set up Trojan
horses to capture passwords, then erased their trails behind them.</p>

<p>The Chaos Computer Club, huh? I'd heard rumors that back in 1985, a
few German hackers banded together to "explore" computer networks. To
them the government monopoly only made trouble&#8212;they called it
the "Bundespest."<a href="#fn310" id="ret310" name="ret310">[*]</a>
They soon developed into a gang that systematically attacked computers
in Germany, Switzerland, France, and eventually the United
States. Those pseudonyms I'd heard of before&#8212;Pengo, Zombie,
Frimp&#8212;were all members . . . self-styled cyberpunks who prided
themselves on how many computers they could break into.</p>

<p>Sounded familiar.<a id="p310" name="p310"></a></p>

<p>By the end of the summer, the problem had spread. The Chaos gang
broke into a hundred computers around the world, using the NASA SPAN
network. Wait a second. The Petvax computer! Those alarms in
June&#8212;I'd traced them back to the NASA network. I'll bet that the
connection wended its way all the way back to Germany. Uh oh.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, I realized what was happening. The Chaos Computer Club
had broken into computers at the CERN physics laboratory in
Switzerland, and caused endless headaches there&#8212;they were said
to have stolen passwords, destroyed software, and crashed experimental
systems.</p>

<p>All for the fun of it.</p>

<p>From the Swiss laboratory, Chaos members had stolen passwords to
reach into computers at American physics labs&#8212;Fermilab in
Illinois, Caltech, and Stanford. From there, it was a short hop to the
NASA network and into NASA's computers.</p>

<p>Every time they entered a computer, they used the bug to become
system manager. Then they modified the operating system to let them in
with a special password&#8212;one known only to them. Now, whenever a
Chaos Club member used the magic password on an injured Vax computer,
they'd get in ... even if the original hole was fixed!</p>

<p>Whoa! Serious stuff here. Hundreds of computers were at risk. They
could easily wreck the software on each system. But what to do? NASA's
not responsible for each computer connected to its network. Half of
them are at universities, running scientific experiments. NASA
probably doesn't even have a list of all the computers attached to its
network.</p>

<p>The NASA network, like the Milnet, is a roadway connecting
computers around the country. A burglar will naturally use that road,
but that's hardly the fault of the road's builder. NASA's only
responsible for keeping the road intact. The security of each computer
rests in the hands of the people running it.</p>

<p>The Chaos Computer Club created headaches for network
folks&#8212;they were thumbing their noses at hundreds of system
managers and thousands of scientists. If you owned a Vax computer, you
had to rebuild the system software<a id="p311" name="p311"></a> from
scratch. That's an afternoon's work. Multiply that by a thousand
sites. Or was it fifty thousand?</p>

<p>At last the Chaos Club triumphantly announced their break-ins to
the press, painting themselves as brilliant programmers. I searched
for any mention of my laboratory, of Milnet, or of
Hannover. Nothing. It was as if they'd never heard of my hacker. Yet
what a coincidence: a couple months after I nail a German hacker
breaking into computer networks, a German club goes public, saying
that they've prowled through NASA's networks.</p>

<p>Could this be who had broken into my computer? I thought for a
while. The Chaos gang seemed to work with the VMS operating system and
knew little about Unix. My hacker certainly knew VMS, but he seemed
more at home on Unix. And he had no hesitation to exploit any bug in
the computer. Hannover is close to Hamburg, the home of Chaos. Less
than a hundred miles.</p>

<p>But my hacker was arrested on June 29. The Chaos Club was breaking
into systems during August.</p>

<p>Hmmm. If the LBL hacker from Hannover was in contact with the Chaos
Club, his arrest would send shock waves through the entire
club. They'd evaporate as soon as they heard that one of their members
had been arrested.</p>

<p>Another wrinkle . . . NASA doesn't have secrets. Oh, perhaps the
military shuttle payloads are classified. But almost everything else
about NASA is public. Right down to the design of their rockets. Hell,
you can buy the space shuttle's blueprints. Not the place for a
spy.</p>

<p>No, my hacker wasn't in Chaos. Probably he was loosely tied into
their club . . . perhaps he checked into their electronic bulletin
board. But they didn't know about him.</p>

<p>Chaos Club members justify their actions with a peculiar set of
ethics. They claim that it's perfectly all right for them to roam
through others' databases, so long as they don't destroy any
information. In other words, they believe their technicians' curiosity
should take precedence over my personal privacy. They claim the right
to peruse any computer they can break into.</p>

<p>Information in databases? They've no qualms, if they can figure out
how to get it. Suppose it's a list of AIDS patients? Or your last
year's income tax return? Or my credit history?<a id="p312"
name="p312"></a> Darren had been great to talk to about all of this,
with his knowledge of networks and sharp eye for holes. But whenever
we talked, he seemed amused and distant, looking at the hacker problem
purely as an intellectual game. I felt that he looked down at me for
getting caught up in it, being out to get the hacker.</p>

<p>Finally one afternoon after Darren had patiently listened to my
whining about the hacker and my gloomy predictions of future trouble,
he fixed me with a stare.</p>

<p>"Cliff," he said, "you're an old fart. Why do you care so much that
someone's frolicking in your system. That could have been you, in your
distant youth. Where's your appreciation of creative anarchy?"</p>

<p>I tried to defend myself&#8212;as I'd tried with Laurie, months
ago. I hadn't set out to be a network cop. I'd started with a simple
puzzle: why did my accounting show a 75-cent error? One thing led to
another, and I ended up on the trail of our friend.</p>

<p>And I didn't just blunder around in a blind rage, trying to nab the
guy just because he was there. I learned what our networks are. I had
thought of them as a complicated technical device, a tangle of wires
and circuits. But they're much more than that&#8212;a fragile
community of people, bonded together by trust and cooperation. If that
trust is broken, the community will vanish forever.</p>

<p>Darren and other programmers sometimes expressed respect for
hackers because they test the soundness of systems, reveal holes and
weaknesses. I could respect this view&#8212;it takes a rigorous,
honest mind to feel gratitude to someone who exposes our
mistakes&#8212;but I could no longer agree with it. I saw the hacker
not as a chess master, teaching us all valuable lessons by exploiting
the weak points in our defenses, but as a vandal, sowing distrust and
paranoia.</p>

<p>In a small town, where people never locked their doors, would we
praise the first burglar for showing the townspeople how foolish it
was to leave their houses open? After it happened, the town couldn't
ever go back to open doors.</p>

<p>Hacking may mean that computer networks will have to have elaborate
locks and checkpoints. Legitimate users will find it harder to
communicate freely, sharing less information<a id="p313"
name="p313"></a> with each other. To use the network, we all might
have to identify ourselves and state our purpose&#8212;no more logging
on casually just to gossip, doodle around, see who else is on the
net.</p>

<p>There's plenty of room for truly "creative anarchy" on the networks
as they are&#8212;nobody is in charge of them, nobody makes the
rules&#8212;they exist purely out of cooperative effort and they
evolve freely at the whim of their users. A hacker's abuse of this
openness might mean the end of the casual, communal way the networks
are run.</p>

<p>I could finally answer Darren. All my buddying up with spooks in
suits and playing computer cop <em>came from</em> my appreciation for
creative anarchy. To have the networks as our playground, we have to
preserve our sense of trust; to do that, we have to take it seriously
when people break that trust.</p>

<p>But though I finally felt like I knew why I'd done it, I still
didn't know what I had done. What was the guy's name in Hannover? Who
was behind the whole thing? Nobody would tell me.</p>

<p>As the summer stretched on, the case showed every indication of
dying out. Mike Gibbons didn't call and seldom returned my calls. It
was as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>I understood the technical aspects of the case&#8212;the computer's
holes and the hacker's location. Wasn't that all I'd wanted? But
something was wrong. This wasn't satisfying.</p>

<p>I knew the whats and the hows. I wanted to know the who's and
whys.</p>

<h3>54</h3>

<p class="first">Who's behind it? Only one way to find out. Do
research.</p>

<p>The FBI wouldn't tell me anything except, "Be quiet and don't ask
questions." Not helpful.</p>

<p>Maybe my poking around would upset some trial that was going
on. But if there was a trial, surely they'd need my cooperation. After
all, I had the crucial evidence: a<a id="p314" name="p314"></a> couple
thousand pages of printouts, all neatly folded into boxes and locked
up in a janitor's closet.</p>

<p>Well, even if I couldn't ask questions, I could still do
science. Publishing your results is as much a part of research as
investigating a weirdness. In my case probably more important. As
rumors of this hacker spread, military people began to call, asking
for more information. What should I tell them?</p>

<p>The end of August marked a year after we'd first detected this
hacker in our computers, and two months after we finally nailed him in
Hannover. The FBI still told me to keep quiet.</p>

<p>Of course, the FBI couldn't legally prevent me from publishing, or
even poking around. Martha was adamant: "You're free to write what you
wish. That's what the First Amendment's all about."</p>

<p>She should know. She was in the midst of studying constitutional
law for her bar exam. Just three more weeks, and it'd be all over. To
take her mind off the exam, we began sewing a quilt. Just a few
minutes here and there, but the design grew and grew, and though I
didn't realize it, something wonderful was growing with it.</p>

<p>We split up the work of making the quilt the way we always
had. She'd do the piecing, I'd sew the squares, and we'd both share
the quilting. We'd just started cutting the pieces when Laurie stopped
by for brunch.</p>

<p>Martha showed her the design and explained that the quilt would be
called "Garden Star." The central blazing star would be bright yellow
and orange, like the peonies in our garden. Surrounding it would be a
ring of tulips, and then a border called "snowball," like the snowball
bushes we had, the first plants to bloom in spring. Laurie suggested
another border, called "flying geese," to represent the birds in the
garden.</p>

<p>Listening to Laurie and Martha talk about quilting patterns, each
one with its ancient, romantic name, I felt a deep warmth. Here was my
home, my love. The quilt we were making now would last our whole
lives; in fact, it would outlive us and still be there to comfort our
grandchildren . . .</p>

<p>Whoa. I was getting carried away. After all, Martha and I weren't
married or anything, just living together, just<a id="p315"
name="p315"></a> sharing our lives while it was good for both of us,
free to move on if things weren't working out. Yeah. It was better
that way, more open and enlightened. None of this old-fashioned "till
death do us part" stuff.</p>

<p>Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>Laurie startled me, her words somehow picking up on my private
thoughts. "This should be your wedding quilt." Martha and I both
stared at her.</p>

<p>"Really. You two are already married&#8212;anyone can see
it. You've been best friends and lovers for almost eight years. So why
don't you make it official and celebrate?"</p>

<p>I was completely at a loss. What Laurie had said was so true and
obvious that I'd been blind not to see it. I had been stuck thinking
that we should just go on, one day at a time, being together "for
now," while things were good. But really, would I leave Martha if we
were going through hard times? Would I leave her if someone else
attracted me more? Was that the kind of person I wanted to be, and the
way I wanted to live the rest of my life?</p>

<p>At that moment I realized what to do, and how I wanted to live. I
looked at Martha, her face calm and still, bent over the bright pieces
of calico. There were tears in my eyes, and I couldn't speak. I looked
at Laurie for help, but the moment she saw my face, she vanished into
the kitchen to make tea, leaving Martha and me alone together.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart?"</p>

<p>She raised her head and looked at me steadily.</p>

<p>"When do you want to get married?"</p>

<p>"What about next spring, after the rainy season, when there are
roses?"</p>

<p>So it was done. No looking back, no regrets, no glancing around to
see if someone better would come along. Martha and me, for the rest of
our lives. Laurie poured out the tea, and we all sat together, not
saying much, but so happy.</p>

<p>By October I started thinking about the hacker again. Darren and I
argued about whether to publish a paper. "If you don't say something,"
Darren argued, "some other hacker will wreck someone else's
computer."</p>

<p>"But if I do publish, it'll teach a dozen hackers how."</p>

<p>That's the problem with talking about security problems. If you
describe how to make a pipe bomb, the next kid that<a id="p316"
name="p316"></a> finds some charcoal and saltpeter will become a
terrorist. Yet if you suppress the information, people won't know the
danger.</p>

<p>January marked six months since the hacker had been busted, a year
and a half since we'd first detected him. Yet I still didn't know his
name. It was about time to publish my results.</p>

<p>So I sent the paper to <em>Communications of the Association of
Computer Machinery.</em> Though you won't find it on
newsstands, <em>Communications</em> reaches most computer
professionals, and it's a real scientific journal: every article is
refereed. Which meant that three other computer scientists checked
over my article and made anonymous comments on whether it should be
published.</p>

<p>The paper was to come out in the May issue. Together, the
Association for Computer Machinery and Lawrence Berkeley Labs
scheduled a joint announcement for May first.</p>

<p>May would be a goofy month. Martha and I planned on getting married
at the end of the month. We'd reserved the Berkeley Rose Garden, sewn
our wedding clothes, and invited our friends and relatives. Even
without the publicity of the hacker, this month wouldn't be calm.</p>

<p>Well, we were pretty much all set when the German
magazine <em>Quick</em> got there first. On April 14, they printed a
story about how a German hacker had broken into three dozen military
computers. Although their reporter had managed to meet the hacker,
most of their story came from my logbook.</p>

<p>My logbook! How did <em>Quick</em> magazine, a cross
between <em>Life</em> and the <em>National Enquirer,</em> manage to
get ahold of my laboratory logbook? I'd kept my logbook on my
computer&#8212;it lived on disks, not on paper. Did someone break into
my computer and read my logbook?</p>

<p>Impossible. My logbook was on my Macintosh: I never connected to
any network, and I hid the disk in my desk every night.</p>

<p>I reread the translation of the article, and realized that someone
had leaked a copy of my logbook from a year ago, January. Before I'd
set up the phony SDINET sting. Had I given a copy of that logbook to
anyone?<a id="p317" name="p317"></a></p>

<p>Yes, I had. On January 10, I'd sent the logbook to Mike Gibbons at
the FBI. He must have forwarded it to the Legal Attach&#233; in
Bonn. Who knew where it landed next?</p>

<p>Someone had leaked it to <em>Quick</em> magazine. And they
published the story two weeks before I was going to. Damn.</p>

<p>One year of silence. A year of covert cooperation with the
authorities. Betrayed to a cheap tabloid in Germany. How
ignominious.</p>

<p>Even with a copy of my notebook, <em>Quick</em> was anything but
accurate. Not much to do but get the facts out ourselves. Damn.</p>

<p>Whatever we did, we'd be late. John Markoff&#8212;now at the New
York <em>Times</em>&#8212;had heard about the story and was asking
questions. Damn. Only one thing to do: my lab announced a press
conference. With me at center stage. Damn.</p>

<p>That evening, at 11 P.M., I was nervous and worried sick. Me? At a
press conference? A phone call from the NSA didn't help, either.</p>

<p>Sally Knox, an administrator with NSA's computer security center,
was in town. She'd heard about tomorrow's press conference. "Don't you
dare mention our name," she barked into my ear. "We get enough bad
press as it is."</p>

<p>I look at Martha. She hears this woman's voice from the phone and
rolls her eyes. I try to soothe the spook's worries.</p>

<p>"Look, Sally, NSA hasn't done anything wrong. I'm not about to say
that your funding ought to be cut."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. As soon as the media hears our name, there'll
be trouble. They distort everything about us. They'll never publish a
fair story."</p>

<p>I look at Martha. She's motioning me to hang up.</p>

<p>"OK, Sally," I said. "I'll make sure that I don't even mention your
agency. If anyone asks, I'll just say, 'No comment.' "</p>

<p>"No, don't do that. Then those pigs will sniff around and pick up
more. Tell them that we had nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>"Look, I'm not gonna lie, Sally. And anyway, isn't the National
Computer Security Center a public, unclassified agency?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. But that's no reason to let the press prowl
around."<a id="p318" name="p318"></a></p>

<p>"Then why don't you send one of your people to my press
conference?"</p>

<p>"None of our employees are authorized to talk to the media."</p>

<p>With this attitude, it's no wonder her agency gets such bad
press.</p>

<p>Martha wrote me a note: "Ask her if she's ever heard of the First
Amendment," but I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Sally went on about
how the Congress was out to get them, the press was out to get them,
and I was out to get them.</p>

<p>She ranted for twenty-five minutes, trying to convince me not to
mention NSA or the National Computer Security Center.</p>

<p>It's 11:30 at night, I'm exhausted, and I can't take any more. I'll
do anything to get off the phone.</p>

<p>"Listen, Sally," I say, "where do you get off, telling me what I
can't say?"</p>

<p>"I'm not telling you what to say. I'm telling you not to mention
the Computer Security Center."</p>

<p>I hang up.</p>

<p>Martha rolls over in bed and looks at me. "Are they all like
that?"</p>

<p>The next morning's press conference was a zoo. I'm accustomed to
scientific meetings and technical seminars. You always hear about
press conferences, but I'd never actually seen one. Now I'm the target
of one.</p>

<p>It was nuts. Along with my boss, Roy Keith, I spouted for half an
hour, answering questions from reporters. The television reporters
asked easy ones ("How do you feel now that it's over?"), while the
newspaper people asked jagged, tough questions&#8212;"What should be
the national policy on computer security?" Or "Was Admiral Poindexter
justified in clamping down on sensitive but unclassified
material?"</p>

<p>Nobody asked about the NSA. Not a mention of the National Computer
Security Center. Sally had blathered for half an hour in vain.</p>

<p>Beforehand, I'd been pretty jaded on the press. Figured that they'd
distort whatever happened. Now here was a technical story, spanning
two continents and a year's work. How would the American media report
it?<a id="p319" name="p319"></a></p>

<p>Amazingly accurately. My technical article had more
details&#8212;the Gnu-Emacs hole, how the hacker cracked
passwords&#8212;but I was astounded by how well newspapers conveyed
the story. The important stuff was there&#8212;the military computers,
the sting, even Operation Showerhead.</p>

<p>And these reporters did their homework. They called Germany and
somehow dug up what I had never found: the hacker's name. They phoned
the hacker.</p>

<h3>55</h3>

<p class="first">"Hello, is this Markus Hess in Hannover?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This is Richard Covey. I'm a reporter here in California. May I
talk with you?"</p>

<p>"I cannot talk."</p>

<p>"About this hacker case&#8212;could you tell me if you worked alone
or with someone else?"</p>

<p>"I cannot answer that. The case is still running in the German
courts."</p>

<p>"What were your intentions?"</p>

<p>"It was strictly a hobby."</p>

<p>"Are you a student?"</p>

<p>"Uh, yes. I cannot speak on the phone because I do not trust the
lines. They may be tapped."</p>

<p>"Do you have a lawyer?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is his name?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Do you know Laszlo Balogh in Pittsburgh?"</p>

<p>"No. Never heard of him, except for the newspaper stories."</p>

<p>"Can you speculate on how Balogh got the false data?"</p>

<p>"I cannot answer that question."</p>

<p>"Did you work with anyone?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say. I am not comfortable talking. I am not sure that the
lines are clean."</p>

<p>"Were you a spy?"<a id="p320" name="p320"></a></p>

<p>"Ha. Anyone who believes that is ridiculous. I was just
curious."</p>

<p>"Can you guess how the data got to Pittsburgh?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot guess. I did not show it to anyone. It is dangerous
for me to say anything more because I do not know if the telephone
lines are clean."</p>

<p>"Were you paid for your work?"</p>

<p>"I must go now. I cannot talk." Click.</p>

<p>Markus Hess. After all this time, my cuckoo's name is Markus
Hess.</p>

<p>Well, he speaks English, although without contractions. And he's as
paranoid on the telephone as he is on the computer&#8212;always
looking over his shoulder. German newspapers report that Hess is five
foot ten inches, twenty-five years old, broad-shouldered, and known to
his friends as a solid but not brilliant Unix programmer. And he
chain-smokes Benson and Hedges.</p>

<p>Once again, I page through the Hannover telephone
directory. There's his name, all right, but who is he? What's this guy
up to? I'll never find out from Berkeley.</p>

<p>Maybe I should call someone in Germany? Who do I know there? A
couple students at the Max Planck Institute. Some astronomers in
Darmstadt. And a college buddy in Hamburg.</p>

<p>Around the end of the summer, a friend of a friend sent a letter to
me: "I need a place to stay while visiting San Francisco. Mind if I
sleep on your floor?" Seemed it was a high school student visiting
from abroad.</p>

<p>Martha, Claudia, and I don't exactly run a youth hostel, but our
door's always open for visitors. Michael Sperber stayed for a couple
nights and kept us amused with tales of touring the States. Just as
interesting to me: his dad, Jochen Sperber, is a reporter in Northern
Germany and could make contact with hackers around Hannover.</p>

<p>I struck paydirt. By chance, I'd found someone who was curious,
persistent, and able to dig up the facts in Germany. Over the next
five months, Jochen Sperber found enough information to piece together
what happened at the other end of the trail.</p>

<p>What really happened? Here's my estimate, based on interviews,
police reports, newspaper accounts, and messages from German computer
programmers.<a id="p321" name="p321"></a></p>

<p>I'd been chasing a shadow. Now I could sketch a portrait.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>In the early '80s, the Bundespost expanded the German telephone
service to include data networking. Their Datex service got off to a
slow start, but by 1985 businesses and universities began
subscribing. It was a convenient, if not cheap, way to interconnect
computers spread across Germany.</p>

<p>As everywhere, students started to exploit this service. First,
discovering flaws in the system's protections; later, finding ways to
connect abroad through the network. The Bundespost had its hands full
in starting up Datex, and pretty much ignored these hackers.</p>

<p>A dozen hackers started the Chaos Computer Club, whose members
specialize in creating viruses, breaking into computers, and serving
as a computer counterculture. Some are cyberpunks; a few are extremely
proficient in computing, others little more than novices. Through
electronic bulletin boards and telephone links, they anonymously
exchanged phone numbers of hacked computers, as well as stolen
passwords and credit cards.</p>

<p>Markus Hess knew of the Chaos Club, although he was never a central
figure there. Rather, he kept his distance as a free-lance
hacker. During the day, he worked at a small software firm in downtown
Hannover.</p>

<p>Over a crackling phone connection, Jochen Sperber said, "You see,
Hess knew Hagbard, who kept in touch with other hackers in Germany,
like Pengo and Bresinsky. Hagbard is a pseudonym, of course. His real
name is . . ."</p>

<p>Hagbard. I'd heard that name before. After I hung up the phone, I
searched my logbook for Hagbard. There he was&#8212; he'd broken into
Fermilab and Stanford. Yet I'd seen it elsewhere. I searched databases
at school and asked friends. Not a peep. For the next three days, I
asked every person I met, in hopes that it might ring a bell with
someone.</p>

<p>At last, at a Berkeley bookstore, the woman behind the counter
said, "Why sure. Hagbard is the hero of the Illuminati books." It's a
series of science fiction novels, about an international conspiracy
that controls the world. The Illuminati run&#8212;and
ruin&#8212;everything. Against this age-old secret cult, Hagbard leads
a small band of anarchists.<a id="p322" name="p322"></a></p>

<p>So Hess's compatriot runs under the alias of Hagbard. He must
really believe that there's a conspiracy out there. And he probably
feels that I'm one of the secret illuminati&#8212; out to suppress the
good guys!</p>

<p>Maybe he's right. A couple of my radical friends would agree with
him. But I sure don't know any secrets.</p>

<p>Well, Hagbard worked closely with Markus Hess. The two drank beers
together at Hannover bars, and spent evenings behind Hess's
computer.</p>

<p>Who's Hagbard? According to the German magazine <em>Der
Spiegel,</em> Hagbard&#8212;Karl Koch&#8212;was a
twenty-three-year-old programmer who needed money to support a stiff
cocaine habit, not to mention monthly telephone bills for overseas
hacking adventures.</p>

<p>During 1986, some hackers from Berlin and Hannover discussed (over
alcohol and drugs) how to raise some money.</p>

<p>Pengo&#8212;real name Hans Huebner&#8212;was an accomplished
eighteen-year-old programmer who claimed to be in it for the pure
technical challenge. He was bored with those computers that he had
legal access to, so he started breaking into systems via the
international networks. In a message posted to a bulletin board, Pengo
said that he was involved with "a circle of persons who tried to make
deals with an eastern secret service."</p>

<p>Why? Since the software on the systems that he had legal access to
"didn't turn me on anymore, I enjoyed the lax security of the systems
I had access to by using [international] networks." Computing had
become an addiction for Pengo.</p>

<p>But why sell the information to the Soviet bloc agents? According
to <em>Der Spiegel,</em> he needed money to invest in his computing
company. So Pengo got together with a couple others in West
Berlin. One of them, Dirk Brezinski, is a programmer and
troubleshooter for the German computer firm Siemens. Another, Peter
Carl, also in Berlin, is a former croupier who "always had enough
cocaine."</p>

<p>These five worked together to discover new ways to break into
computers, exploring military networks and sharpening their skills at
cracking operating systems. Pengo specialized in Digital's Vax VMS
operating system and frequently talked with Hagbard.</p>

<p>Pengo had no scruples about selling information to
Soviet<a id="p323" name="p323"></a> bloc agents. He saw himself as
ethically neutral&#8212;he didn't want to give the Russians any
advantage; he just wanted to have fun on the networks.</p>

<p>And pick up some cash along the way.</p>

<p>Hess, too, just played around the networks, searching for ways to
connect around the world. He'd dropped out of the University of Hagen,
where he didn't quite finish a degree in mathematics and
physics. (Physics? If only he'd known!)</p>

<p>At first, Hess apparently just played around the networks,
searching for ways to connect around the world. Like a ham radio
operator, he started out a hobbyist, trying to reach as far away as
possible. At first, he managed to connect to Karlsruhe; later he
reached Bremen over the Datex network.</p>

<p>Soon, he discovered that many system managers hadn't locked their
back doors. Usually these were university computers, but Markus Hess
began to wonder: how many other systems were wide open? What other
ways could you sneak into computers?</p>

<p>In early 1986, Hagbard and Pengo were routinely breaking into
computers in North America: mostly high-energy physics labs, but a few
NASA sites as well. Hagbard described his exploits to Hess.</p>

<p>The challenge was there. Hess began to explore outside of
Germany. But he no longer cared about universities and physics
labs&#8212;he wanted real excitement. Hess and Hagbard would target
the military.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Chaos Computer Club had issued a warning to
their members: "Never penetrate a military computer. The security
people on the other side will be playing a game with you&#8212;almost
like chess. Remember that they've practiced this game for centuries."
Markus Hess wasn't listening.</p>

<p>Hess found his way into an unprotected computer belonging to a
German subsidiary of the U.S. defense contractor, Mitre. Once inside
that system, he could have discovered detailed instructions to link
into Mitre's computers in Bedford, Massachusetts, and McLean,
Virginia.</p>

<p>Why not? The system was wide open, and let him call anywhere in
America.</p>

<p>By summer 1986, Hess and Hagbard were operating separately, but
frequently comparing notes. They collaborated<a id="p324"
name="p324"></a> in methodically twisting all doorknobs as they walked
down the streets of the military networks.</p>

<p>Hess soon expanded his beachhead at Mitre. He explored their system
internally, then sent out tentacles into other American computers. He
collected telephone numbers and network addresses, and methodically
attacked these systems. On August 20, he struck Lawrence Berkeley
Lab.</p>

<p>Even then, Hess was only fooling around. He'd realized that he was
privy to secrets, both industrial and national, but kept his mouth
shut. Then, around the end of September, in a smoky Hannover beer
garden, he described his latest exploit to Hagbard.</p>

<p>You can't make money by breaking into universities and
colleges. Who's interested in data from physics labs, other than a few
grad students?</p>

<p>But military bases and defense contractors? Hagbard smelled
money.</p>

<p>And Hagbard sensed who to contact: Pengo, in West Berlin.</p>

<p>Pengo, with his contacts to hackers across Germany, knew how to use
Hess's information. Carrying Hess's printouts, one of the Berlin
hackers crossed into East Berlin and met with agents from the Soviet
KGB.</p>

<p>The deal was made: around 30,000 Deutschmarks&#8212;$18,000&#8212;
for printouts and passwords.</p>

<p>The KGB wasn't just paying for printouts, though. Hess and company
apparently sold their techniques as well: how to break into Vax
computers; which networks to use when crossing the Atlantic; details
on how the Milnet operates.</p>

<p>Even more important to the KGB was obtaining research data about
Western technology, including integrated circuit design,
computer-aided manufacturing, and, especially, operating system
software that was under U.S. export control. They offered 250,000
Deutschmarks for copies of Digital Equipment's VMS operating
system.</p>

<p>Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski apparently met with the KGB a dozen
times, filling many of their requests: source code to the Unix
operating system, designs for high-speed gallium-arsenide integrated
circuits, and computer programs used to engineer computer memory
chips.</p>

<p>Alone, the source code to Unix isn't worth $130,000. Chip designs?
Perhaps. But a sophisticated computer design<a id="p325"
name="p325"></a> program . . . well, maybe the KGB did get its money's
worth.</p>

<p>Hagbard wanted more than Deutschmarks. He demanded cocaine. The KGB
was a willing supplier.</p>

<p>Hagbard passed some of the money (but none of the cocaine) to Hess,
in return for printouts, passwords, and network information. Hagbard's
cut went to pay his telephone bill, sometimes running over a thousand
dollars a month, as he called computers around the world.</p>

<p>Hess saved everything. He kept a detailed notebook and saved every
session on a floppy disk. This way, after he disconnected from a
military computer, he could print out the interesting parts, and pass
these along to Hagbard and on to the KGB.</p>

<p>Also the KGB's wish list was SDI data. As Hess searched for it, I
naturally detected SDI showing up in his requests. And Martha's
Operation Showerhead fed Hess plenty of SDI fodder.</p>

<p>But could the KGB trust these printouts? How could they be certain
that Hagbard wasn't inventing all of this to feed his own coke
habit?</p>

<p>The KGB decided to verify the German hacker ring. The mythical
Barbara Sherwin served as a perfect way to test the validity of this
new form of espionage. She had, after all, invited people to write to
her for more information.</p>

<p>But secret services don't handle things directly. They use
intermediaries. The KGB contacted another agency&#8212;either the
Hungarian or Bulgarian intelligence service. They, in turn, apparently
had a professional relationship with a contact in Pittsburgh: Laszlo
Balogh.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian embassy in America probably has a standing agreement
with Laszlo along the lines of "We'll pay you $100 for mailing the
following letter ..."</p>

<p>Laszlo Balogh didn't care one way or another. According to Roger
Stuart of the <em>Pittsburgh Press,</em> Laszlo billed himself as a
Hungarian refugee; a draftsman; a credit corporation employee; a
trucking company owner; a diamond dealer; a world traveler; a
bodyguard for Kuwaiti princesses; a CIA hit man; and an FBI
informant.</p>

<p>The reporter wrote "Although he has claimed extensive foreign
government contacts and driven expensive foreign cars, he once
testified that he had difficulty recording an<a id="p326"
name="p326"></a> undercover conversation for the FBI because the
recorder kept slipping beneath his sweat suit."</p>

<p>Apparently Balogh ran a now-defunct company when a forged check
drawn on a nonexistent bank was used to obtain a garbage hauling
contract. Other times he was involved in schemes to steal $38,000 in
diamonds, and to sell computer equipment to the Soviets. Indeed, he
once claimed to have been held captive at the Soviet embassy.</p>

<p>As long as the money was green, Laszlo didn't care where it came
from. He knew nothing about SDINET, knew nobody in Hannover, and said
he didn't even own a computer.</p>

<p>Hmmm. I looked over Laszlo's letter. It had been
word-processed&#8212;not a typewriter, but a word processor. If Laszlo
Balogh doesn't own a computer, then who'd created this letter? The
Bulgarian embassy perhaps?</p>

<p>Does the FBI have enough evidence to indict Laszlo Balogh? They
won't tell me. But the way I see it, Laszlo's in deep yogurt: the FBI
is watching him, and whoever's pulling his puppet strings isn't
pleased.</p>

<p>The West German police, though, have plenty of evidence against
Markus Hess. Printouts, phone traces, and my logbook. When they broke
into his apartment on June 29, 1987, they seized a hundred floppy
disks, a computer, and documentation describing the U.S. Milnet. Not
much doubt there.</p>

<p>But when the police raided Hess's apartment, nobody was
home. Though I was waiting patiently for him to appear on my computer,
the German police entered his place when he wasn't connected.</p>

<p>At his first trial, Hess got off on appeal. His lawyer argued that
since Hess wasn't connected at the moment his apartment was raided, he
might not have done the hacking. This, along with a problem in the
search warrants, was enough to overturn the case against Hess on
computer theft. But the German federal police continued to
investigate.</p>

<p>On March 2, 1989, German authorities charged five people with
espionage: Pengo, Hagbard, Peter Carl, Dirk Bresinsky, and Markus
Hess.</p>

<p>Peter Carl met regularly with KGB agents in East Berlin, selling
any data the others could find. When the German BKA caught up with
him, he was about to run off to Spain. He's now in jail, awaiting
trial, along with Dirk<a id="p327" name="p327"></a> Bresinsky, who was
jailed for desertion from the German Army.</p>

<p>Pengo is having second thoughts about his years working for the
KGB. He says that he hopes he "did the right thing by giving the
German police detailed information about my involvement." But as long
as there's an active criminal case, he'll say no more.</p>

<p>All the same, the publicity hasn't helped Pengo's professional
life. His business partners have shied away from backing him, and
several of his computing projects have been canceled. Outside of his
business losses, I'm not sure he feels there's anything wrong in what
he did.</p>

<p>Today, Markus Hess is walking the streets of Hannover, free on bail
while awaiting a trial for espionage. Smoking Benson and Hedges
cigarettes. And looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Hagbard, who hacked with Hess for a year, tried to kick his cocaine
habit in late 1988. But not before spending his profits from the KGB:
he was deep in debt and without a job. In spring 1989 he found a job
at the office of a political party in Hannover. By cooperating with
the police, he and Pengo avoided prosecution for espionage.</p>

<p>Hagbard was last seen alive on May 23, 1989. In an isolated forest
outside of Hannover, police found his charred bones next to a melted
can of gasoline. A borrowed car was parked nearby, keys still in the
ignition.</p>

<p>No suicide note was found.</p>

<h3>56</h3>

<p class="first">When I began this hunt, I saw myself as someone
engaged in mundane tasks. I did what I was assigned to do, avoided
authority, and kept myself peripheral to important issues. I was
apathetic and outside the political sphere. Yeah, I vaguely identified
myself with the old '60s left movement. But I never thought much about
how my work interacted with society . . . maybe I picked astronomy
because it has so little to do with earthly problems.</p>

<p>Now, after sliding down this Alice-in-Wonderland hole, I find the
political left and right reconciled in their mutual<a id="p328"
name="p328"></a> dependency on computers. The right sees computer
security as necessary to protect national secrets; my leftie friends
worry about an invasion of their privacy when prowlers pilfer data
banks. Political centrists realize that insecure computers cost money
when their data is exploited by outsiders.</p>

<p>The computer has become a common denominator that knows no
intellectual, political, or bureaucratic bounds; the Sherwin Williams
of necessity that covers the world, spanning all points of view.</p>

<p>Realizing this, I've become pro-active&#8212;almost rabid&#8212;
about computer security. I worry about protecting our vulnerable data
banks. I wonder what happens on financial networks, where millions of
dollars slosh around every minute. I'm ticked that the Feds don't seem
to be minding the mint. And I'm upset that looters have
proliferated.</p>

<p>It took a lot of crap to make me give a damn. I wish that we lived
in a golden age, where ethical behavior was assumed; where technically
competent programmers respected the privacy of others; where we didn't
need locks on our computers.</p>

<p>I'm saddened to find talented programmers devoting their time to
breaking into computers. Instead of developing new ways to help each
other, vandals make viruses and logic bombs. The result? People blame
every software quirk on viruses, public-domain software lies
underused, and our networks become sources of paranoia.</p>

<p>Fears for security really do louse up the free flow of
information. Science and social progress only take place in the
open. The paranoia that hackers leave in their wake only stifles our
work . . . forcing administrators to disconnect our links to networked
communities.</p>

<p>Yes, you can make secure computers and networks. Systems that
outsiders can't easily break into. But they're usually difficult to
use and unfriendly. And slow. And expensive. Computer communications
already costs too much&#8212; adding cryptographic encoding and
elaborate authentication schemes will only make it worse.</p>

<p>On the other hand, our networks seem to have become the targets of
(and channels for) international espionage. Come to think of it, what
would I do if I were an intelligence<a id="p329" name="p329"></a>
agent? To collect secret information, I might train an agent to speak
a foreign language, fly her to a distant country, supply her with
bribe money, and worry that she might be caught or fed duplicitous
information.</p>

<p>Or I could hire a dishonest computer programmer. Such a spy need
never leave his home country. Not much risk of an internationally
embarrassing incident. It's cheap, too&#8212;a few small computers and
some network connections. And the information returned is
fresh&#8212;straight from the target's word processing system.</p>

<p>Today there's only one country that's not reachable from your
telephone: Albania. What does this mean for the future of
espionage?</p>

<p>Yow! What am I thinking about? I'm not a spy&#8212;I'm just an
astronomer who's been away from science for too long.</p>

<p>As I turned off my monitors and wound up the cables, I realized
that for a year, I'd been caught in a maze. I'd thought I'd been
setting traps; actually, I'd been trapped the whole while. While the
hacker was searching military computers, I was exploring different
communities&#8212;on the networks and in the government. His journey
took him into thirty or forty computers; mine reached into a dozen
organizations.</p>

<p>My own quest had changed. I thought I was hunting for a hacker. I'd
imagined that my work had nothing to do with my home or country
. . . after all, I was just doing my job.</p>

<p>Now, with my computers serviced and holes patched, I biked home,
picked a few strawberries, and mixed some milkshakes for Martha and
Claudia.</p>

<p>Cuckoos will lay their eggs in other nests. I'm returning to
astronomy.<a id="p330" name="p330"></a></p>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p class="first">While I was desperately trying to wrap up the hacker
chase, we also had a wedding to plan. It was a hectic time, and I
cursed my work (and Hess) for distracting me from my home life. We
were going to be married at the end of May, so the April revelations
were particularly awkward, Martha ending up with more than her share
of the preparations.</p>

<p>She was coping, however, firmly resolved to make the wedding true
to who we were. We silk-screened our own invitations, saying that the
two of us, along with our families, were doing the
inviting. Naturally, the ink on the silk-screen leaked through, and
half the invitations had our fingerprints, but that's a part of the
home brew.</p>

<p>Martha decked out in a white dress and veil, and me in a tux?
Absurd. And Laurie in a bridesmaid's outfit? Nobody ever made Laurie
wear a dress for any reason. Somehow we managed. Laurie wore white
linen pants and a tailored jacket, Martha made a simple pale yellow
dress, and I sewed my own cotton shirt. (Try sewing your own shirt
sometime. You'll learn a new respect for shirt makers, especially
after you sew the cuffs on backward.)</p>

<p>So it rained on our wedding and there wasn't a place to hide in the
rose garden. Claudia's string quartet unraveled a tarp, protecting
their violins from the downpour. My sister Jeannie showed up, straight
from her last class at Navy War College&#8212;and straight into a
political argument with Laurie. Of course, after the ceremony, we got
lost driving to a remote inn by the ocean.</p>

<p>It was wonderful, all the same. Say what you will about marriage,
this was the happiest day of my life.</p>

<p>Sure, I could have just stayed living with Martha, never quite
committing myself beyond next month's rent. I'd lived with several
other people in this casual way, saying we were in love, but always
ready to split if things got tough.<a id="p331" name="p331"></a> We
dressed it up with talk about openness and freedom from oppressive
conventions, but for me it was just an excuse. The truth was, I had
never dared to give myself fully to anyone, committing myself to make
it work no matter what. But now I'd found someone I loved and trusted
enough to gather my courage and stand by, not just for now but
forever.</p>

<p>But domestic happiness doesn't solve everything&#8212;I still had
to figure out what to do next. With Hess unmasked, I could return to
astronomy, or at least, computing. Not quite tracking an international
spy ring, but then, there's research to do everywhere. The best part
is not knowing where your science will lead you.</p>

<p>It wasn't the same. The computer people felt I'd wasted the past
couple years rubbing shoulders with spies. The spies didn't have much
use for me&#8212;who needs an astronomer? And the astronomers knew I'd
been away from the field for two years. Where do I go from here?</p>

<p>Martha had passed her bar exam and was clerking for a judge across
the bay, in San Francisco. She loved it&#8212;taking notes on trials,
researching case law, helping to write decisions. A sort of grad
school for law.</p>

<p>She found another clerkship in Boston, starting in August '88. Over
a strawberry milkshake, she described her possibilities:</p>

<p>"I'd clerk for the circuit court in Boston. It'll be more academic
there&#8212;no trials, just appeals. Might be fun."</p>

<p>"And the alternatives?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thinking about returning to school, to finish my degree
in jurisprudence. That'll take a few more years." Always the
academic.</p>

<p>Would I leave Berkeley to follow her to Massachusetts?</p>

<p>Simple decision: I'd follow her anywhere. If she's going to Boston,
I'd dredge up a job there. Fortunately, the Harvard Smithsonian Center
for Astrophysics was looking for a half-breed astronomer-computer
jockey, someone to play with their X-ray astronomy database.</p>

<p>I can mess up a database as well as the next person, and they
didn't mind my hiatus from astronomy. And, being<a id="p332"
name="p332"></a> astronomers, they were already accustomed to people
showing up late and sleeping under desks.</p>

<p>It wasn't easy to leave Berkeley&#8212;the strawberries, the street
vendors, the sunshine&#8212;but we signed a nonaggression pact with
our roommates: we could visit anytime and wouldn't have to wash the
dishes. In return, they could stay at our place in Massachusetts, so
long as they brought some California kiwi fruit.</p>

<p>The hardest part was leaving our roommate Claudia. I'd grown
accustomed to her late-night Mozart practicing (a long way from the
Berkeley Grateful Dead concerts!). She hadn't quite settled down with
a mate, although several promising musicians were courting her just as
we left. The latest gossip? Oh, there's this handsome orchestra
conductor that's simply lusting after her . . .</p>

<p>So, in August 1988, we packed a couple suitcases for a year in
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Being uprooted and towed to the East Coast had a few advantages. My
computer network address changed ... a good thing, since several
hackers had tried to break into it after I published my article. One
or two had threatened me in various ways&#8212;better not to give 'em
a standing target. And various three-letter agencies stopped calling
me, asking for advice, opinions, and rumors. Now, in Cambridge, I
could concentrate on astronomy, and forget about computer security and
hackers.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, I'd become an expert on computer security,
but hadn't learned a thing about astronomy. Worse, the physics of
X-ray astronomy was totally foreign to me: I'm accustomed to planetary
science, and planets don't give off X-rays.</p>

<p>So what do X-ray astronomers look at? The sun. Stars and
quasars. And exploding galaxies.</p>

<p>"Exploding galaxies?" I asked Steve Murray, my new boss at the
Center for Astrophysics. "Galaxies don't explode. They just sit there
in spirals."</p>

<p>"Bah. You learned your astronomy in the "70s," Steve replied. "Why,
we're looking at stars exploding into supernovas, bursts of X-rays
from neutron stars, even stuff falling into black holes. Hang around
here for a while and we'll teach you some real astronomy."<a id="p333"
name="p333"></a></p>

<p>They didn't fool around. Within a week, I was settled behind a
computer, building databases of X-ray observations. Classical
computing, but there's good physics in there. Yow! There really are
black holes in the middle of galaxies. I've seen the data.</p>

<p>The Smithsonian Astrophysical Laboratory shares buildings with
Harvard Observatory. Naturally, everyone's heard of Harvard
Observatory. But the Smithsonian? That's in Washington, isn't it? Only
after I moved to Cambridge did I realize that the Smithsonian had a
hot-damn astronomy section, the Center for Astrophysics. Makes no
difference to me, so long as they're doing good astronomy.</p>

<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts, might be across the country, but
culturally, it's just around the corner from Berkeley. Lots of '60s
hippies, left-wing politics, bookstores, and coffeehouses. There's
street musicians most every night, and you're serenaded at the
downtown subway stations by guitars and mandolins. And the
neighborhoods&#8212;some of these houses are a hundred years
old. Bicycling in Cambridge is sheer excitement&#8212;the drivers aim
right at you. History, weird people, good astronomy, cheap pizza
... all the ingredients for a good place to live.</p>

<p>Marriage? Except that Martha keeps me away from microwave ovens,
it's been a kicker.</p>

<p>Wednesday, November 2, 1988, Martha and I stayed up late, reading a
novel out loud. Around midnight we pulled up the quilt and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>I was dreaming about floating through the air on an oak leaf when
the phone rang. Damn. The glow-in-the-dark clock said 2:25 a.m.</p>

<p>"Hi, Cliff. It's Gene. Gene Miya at NASA Ames Laboratory. No
apologies for waking you up. Our computers are under attack." The
excitement in his voice woke me up.</p>

<p>"Wake up and check your system," Gene said. "Better yet, stay
asleep and check it. But call me back if you see anything
strange."</p>

<p>I'd hung up the phone for ten seconds when it rang again. This
time, the line just beeped. A Morse code beep.</p>

<p>My computer was calling. It wanted my attention.<a id="p334"
name="p334"></a></p>

<p>Oh hell. Can't hide. I stumbled over to the trusty old Macintosh,
dialed into Harvard Observatory's computer, and typed in my account
name, Cliff. Then my non-dictionary password, "Robotcat."</p>

<p>Slow logging in. After five minutes, I gave up. My computer just
wasn't responding. Something was wrong.</p>

<p>Well, as long as I was awake, I might as well see what's on the
West Coast. Maybe there's some electronic mail waiting for me. I
connected over Tymnet into Lawrence Berkeley Labs&#8212;no
long-distance phone calls for me.</p>

<p>The Unix system at Berkeley was slow, too. Frustratingly slow. But
only one other guy was using it. Barren Griffiths.</p>

<p>Over the screen, we exchanged a couple notes:</p>

<pre>
Hi Darren--It's Cliff. How's things :-) Cliff, call me on the phone
right away. We're under attack.  OK O-O
</pre>

<p>O-O means Over and Out. And the :-) is a crude smiley face. You
look at it sideways, and it smiles at you.</p>

<p>2:15 a.m. in Massachusetts isn't yet midnight in Berkeley. Barren
was nowhere near asleep.</p>

<p>"Hi, Barren. What's this attack?"</p>

<p>"Something's eating our system, starting a lot of processes
running. Slowing the system down."</p>

<p>"A hacker?"</p>

<p>"No. I'd guess a virus, but I can't tell right now." Barren spoke
slowly as he typed. "I've been working on it for ten minutes, so I'm
not sure."</p>

<p>Then I remembered Gene Miya's call. "NASA Ames Labs says the same
thing."</p>

<p>"Yeah. I bet we're under attack from the Arpanet," Barren
said. "Yeah, look at all these network connections!"</p>

<p>I couldn't see any&#8212;as long as I talked on the phone, my
computer was disconnected and I was blind. With a single phone line,
either I could speak on the phone, or my Macintosh could talk to
another computer, but not both. I hung up and dialed into my Harvard
computer, a desktop computer made by Sun. Slow. Something was chewing
on it.</p>

<p>I looked at the processes running (with a <em>ps</em>
command,<a id="p335" name="p335"></a> like the hacker had taught
me). There was the virus. But not just running one or two
jobs. Hundreds of connections to other computers.</p>

<p>Each process was trying to talk to some other computer. The
connections came from all over: nearby systems at Harvard, distant
computers from the Arpanet.</p>

<p>As fast as I'd kill one program, another would take its place. I
stomped them all out at once; not a minute later, one
reappeared. Within three minutes, there were a dozen. Holy smoke!</p>

<p>What's crawling around my computer?</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>A biological virus is a molecule which sneaks into a cell and
convinces the cell to copy the virus molecule, instead of the cell's
DNA molecules. Once duplicated, the virus then breaks out of the cell
to infect other cells.</p>

<p>Similarly, a computer virus is a program that replicates
itself. Like its biological namesake, it enters a system, duplicates
itself, and sends copies of itself to other systems.</p>

<p>To the host computer, a virus looks like a series of commands which
appear perfectly legitimate, yet have dire consequences. Often these
commands are buried within ordinary programs, hibernating until the
program is executed. When the infected program is run, all seems fine
until the virus is executed. Then the computer is tricked into copying
the virus instructions elsewhere.</p>

<p>Where? Probably the virus will copy itself into another program on
the same computer, making it tough to eradicate. Or maybe onto another
disk, so that someone will transport it to another computer.</p>

<p>Perhaps the virus will do nothing more than duplicate itself into
other programs. A malicious virus maker, however, might throw in a
side effect: "Copy yourself four times, then erase all the word
processing files."</p>

<p>Computer viruses spread most easily on personal computers: these
machines have no protections built into their operating systems. At a
PC, you can run any program you wish and change any part of memory. On
small computers, it's hard to tell if a program has been changed on a
disk.</p>

<p>Bigger computers, like Unix systems, are more resistant: their
operating systems isolate one user from another, and<a id="p336"
name="p336"></a> set limits on how much you can modify. In addition,
you can't change system programs without permission&#8212;the
operating system's walls seal you out of those sensitive areas.</p>

<p>The virus writer must carefully tailor the program to a target
computer. A program that runs on your IBM PC won't work on my
Macintosh, or my lab's Unix system. Then too, the virus program can't
occupy much space, or it'll easily be discovered and removed.</p>

<p>A virus is a good place to hide time bombs. It's easy to design a
virus whose instructions work like this:</p>

<p>"Copy me into four other programs."</p>

<p>"Wait until February 13."</p>

<p>"Erase all the files on the system."</p>

<p>The virus must find a way to propagate. Simply infecting programs
on one computer will only hurt one person. The creator of a malicious
virus wants the virus to infect hundreds of systems. How do you pass a
program to hundreds of others?</p>

<p>People exchange software on disks. Infect one program on a disk,
and it'll infect every system that runs that program. As the disk is
passed from office to office, dozens of computers can be infected and
possibly wiped out.</p>

<p>Public bulletin boards also exchange software. These dial-in
computers are run by hobbyists, schools, and a few companies. You dial
their number and copy programs from the bulletin board into your home
computer. You can just as easily copy a program from your home system
into the bulletin board. There it'll wait until someone requests
it. And if your program has a virus buried inside, well, you won't
discover it until it's too late.</p>

<p>So computer viruses spread by interchanging programs. Someone
brings an infected program&#8212;a fun game&#8212;into work and runs
it on her office machine. The virus copies itself into her word
processing program. Later she gives her word processing disk to a
friend. Her friend's system gets infected. Oh, each program appears to
work properly. But when February 13 rolls around . . .</p>

<p>The obvious way to prevent viruses is to avoid exchanging
programs. Don't take candy from strangers&#8212;don't accept untrusted
programs. By keeping your computer isolated from others, no virus
program can infect it.<a id="p337" name="p337"></a></p>

<p>This canonical wisdom overlooks our daily needs. Unless we exchange
programs and data, our computers won't be much use to us. There's a
wealth of public-domain software&#8212; much of it ideal for solving
our problems.</p>

<p>Viruses and logic bombs poison this communal well. People stop
trusting public software, and eventually the sources of public
software dry up.</p>

<p>But there's another way for a virus to propagate: directly over a
network.</p>

<p>Our Arpanet interconnects eighty thousand computers across the
country. You can send mail to anyone on these computers, send or
receive files over the Arpanet, or (as Markus Hess showed)
interactively log into computers connected to the Arpanet.</p>

<p>Could a virus propagate over the Arpanet? A program that copies
itself from one computer, out over the network, into another . . .</p>

<p>I'd thought of this before, but had always dismissed the
possibility. Arpanet computers have defenses against viruses: you need
passwords to log into them. Hess got around this by guessing
passwords. Could a virus guess passwords?</p>

<p>At 3:30 in the morning, shivering behind my Macintosh at home, I
dialed into my observatory's computer. It's a Sun workstation, running
the popular Berkeley flavor of Unix. All those hundreds of jobs were
still running ... my system was grossly overloaded. No hacker was
logged in. Just me.</p>

<p>Same symptom at Lawrence Berkeley Labs. And NASA Ames. Smells like
a virus.</p>

<p>I called Darren Griffiths at LBL. "It's a virus," he affirmed. "I
can watch it replicate. Try killing the jobs. They'll come right
back."</p>

<p>"From where?"</p>

<p>"I'm getting connections from five places. Stanford, University of
Rochester, Aerospace Company, the Berkeley campus, and somewhere
called BRL."</p>

<p>"That's the Army's Ballistics Research Lab," I said, remembering a
conversation with BRL's Mike Muuss. "How's the virus getting into your
system?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell, Cliff. The connections are all from the Arpanet, but
it's not the usual way of logging into the<a id="p338"
name="p338"></a> system. Looks like the virus is breaking in through a
hole in the mail system."</p>

<p>Someone's built a virus that exploits a security hole in Unix
systems. The hole is in the mail system, and the virus spreads over
the network. What's the virus doing? Just copying itself, or does it
have a time bomb built in?</p>

<p>It's 4 a.m. What to do? I'd better call the Arpanet controllers and
warn them. There's a twenty-four-hour duty officer at the Network
Operations Center that watches over the network. This morning, they've
heard nothing of this virus. "Better call around, because it'll be all
over the place by nine this morning."</p>

<p>The Networks Operations Center hasn't heard. The virus is only a
few hours old. I'm seeing viruses coming from a dozen other
sites. Virulent. By morning it will have spread to scores or even
hundreds of systems. We've got a problem. A major problem.</p>

<p>An epidemic.</p>

<p>We've got to understand this virus and spread the word. For the
next thirty-six hours I knocked myself out, trying to understand and
defeat this thing. I knew I wasn't alone. At the same time, groups at
Berkeley, MIT, and Purdue University were already hot on the
trail.</p>

<p>Here I'm only describing what I saw, but my struggle was minor
compared to the work of Unix wizards across the country. One by one,
programmers reacted&#8212;gurus like Keith Bostic, Peter Yee, Gene
Spafford, Jon Rochlis, Mark Eichin, Donn Seeley, Ed Wang, and Mike
Muuss. I was but a small part of an unorganized but dedicated response
to this disaster.</p>

<p>I dig into the code in my system in Cambridge. Right off I can see
two versions of the virus. One's customized for Vax computers running
Unix. The other's for Sun workstations. Each file is forty-five
thousand bytes long. If it were English, it would fit in about thirty
pages. But it's not text&#8212;I dump the file and it looks like
gibberish. It doesn't even look like machine code.</p>

<p>Now this doesn't make sense: computer programs <em>look</em> like
machine code. This one doesn't. There's no header block information
and only a few commands that I recognize. The rest is
guacamole.<a id="p339" name="p339"></a></p>

<p>Patiently I try to understand what those few commands do. Suppose I
were a Sun workstation, and someone fed those commands to me. How
would I respond? With a pad of paper, hand calculator, and a booklet
of machine instructions, I start unwinding the virus's code.</p>

<p>The first few commands just strip off some encryption from the rest
of the virus. That's why the virus looks strange. The actual commands
have been purposely obscured.</p>

<p>Aha! The virus writer has hidden his virus: he's tried to prevent
other programmers from understanding his code. Throwing nails on the
road to slow down his pursuers.</p>

<p>Diabolical.</p>

<p>Time to call Darren again. It's 5 a.m. and we're comparing
notes&#8212;he's discovered the same thing and more: "I've unmasked
part of the virus, and I can see it's breaking in through the mail
system. Then, it uses <em>finger</em> and <em>telnet</em> to spread
itself to other computers. It's decrypting passwords by brute force
guessing."</p>

<p>Together, over the phone, we pry apart the program. Its whole
purpose seems to be to copy itself into other computers. It searches
for network connections&#8212;nearby computers, distant systems,
anything that it can reach.</p>

<p>Whenever the virus program discovers a computer on the network, it
tries to break into it, using several obscure holes in the Unix
operating system.</p>

<p>Holes in Unix? Sure.</p>

<p>When you send mail from one Unix computer to another, the
Unix <em>Sendmail</em> program handles the transfer. A mail message
arrives from the network and <em>Sendmail</em> forwards it to the
addressee. It's an electronic post office that pigeonholes mail.</p>

<p><em>Sendmail</em> has a hole. Normally, a foreign computer sends
messages into this program and everyone's happy. But if there's a
problem, you can ask the program to enter debug mode&#8212;the
program's back door.</p>

<p>When you're in debug, <em>Sendmail</em> lets you issue ordinary
Unix commands from a foreign computer. Commands like "Execute the
following program."</p>

<p>So that's how this virus spawned copies. It mailed copies of itself
to other computers and commanded them to execute the virus
program.<a id="p340" name="p340"></a></p>

<p>After the virus program started, it searched for other computers to
infect and sent mail messages to them.</p>

<p>On some systems, <em>Sendmail</em> had been fixed. If so, the virus
tried yet another hole: the finger daemon.</p>

<p>To see if I've been using a Unix system, you can issue the
command, <em>finger cliff.</em> If I've been logged in, Unix will
respond with my name, phone number, and what I'm up to. It works well
over the network; often I'll just finger someone before calling their
telephone.</p>

<p>The virus invaded through the program that handled finger
requests. The finger daemon has room for 512 characters of data; the
virus sent 536 characters. What happened to the extra 24 characters?
They got executed as commands to Unix.</p>

<p>By overflowing the finger daemon, the virus found a second way to
execute the command "Execute the following program" on someone else's
computer.</p>

<p>If that wasn't enough, the virus had a password guesser built
in. It tried to log into nearby, trusted computers, using a few
hundred common passwords. If it guessed a valid password, it copied
itself into the computer and started all over.</p>

<p>Whew! Any one of these ways would impregnate a lot of
computers. Taken together, they formed a fiendishly effective
virus.</p>

<p>Like a sorcerer's apprentice, the program kept copying itself from
one computer to another. Erase one copy, and a new one would spring
into its place. Plug up one hole, and the virus would try a different
hole.</p>

<p>Did I say virus?</p>

<p>"You know, Cliff, a virus modifies other programs when it
runs. This thing doesn't change other programs; it just copies
itself," Darren explained. "It's really not a virus, it's a network
worm."</p>

<p>A virus copies itself into other programs, changing the program
itself. A worm copies itself from one computer to another. Both are
contagious; either can spread havoc.</p>

<p>Viruses usually infect personal computers, spreading through floppy
disks and copied programs. Worms strike over networks, spreading
through the very connections used for electronic mail and
communications.<a id="p341" name="p341"></a></p>

<p>But at 5 a.m., all I knew was that my computers were bogged down
and it's the fault of this self-replicating program. It's a cuckoo,
laying eggs in other birds' nests.</p>

<p>Worm or virus, whoever built it has deliberately thrown up
roadblocks to prevent anyone from understanding it. The code's
encrypted, and it hides its internal tables. It erases any evidence of
its parent worm. It feints by appearing to send a message to a
Berkeley computer, while actually sending nothing at all&#8212;an
attempt to draw attention away from the real source of the
program.</p>

<p>By 6 a.m., Thursday morning, I'm thinking about the effects of this
worm: a disaster's brewing, and someone needs to be notified. Who?</p>

<p>I've called the Arpanet Network Operations Center. They can't do
much&#8212;even if they turn off the whole network, the worm will
still breed, moving around local networks. Better call the National
Computer Security Center. Who do I know there? Bob Morris, their chief
scientist.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>I knew Bob Morris was on his computer at 6:30 A.M. Thursday
morning. I could see him logged into NSA's Dockmaster computer. After
posting a message to that machine, I called him on the phone.</p>

<p>"Hi, Bob. We've got troubles. A virus is spreading over the
Arpanet, and it's infesting Unix computers."</p>

<p>"When did it start?"</p>

<p>"Around midnight, I'd guess. Maybe earlier&#8212;I just don't
know. I've been up all night trying to understand it."</p>

<p>"How's it spread?"</p>

<p>"Through a hole in the Unix mail program."</p>

<p>"You must mean <em>Sendmail.</em> Hell, I've known about that for
years." Bob Morris might have known, but he had never told me.</p>

<p>"Whoever wrote the virus must be laughing, but it's going to mean a
rough day for everyone."</p>

<p>"Any ideas who started it?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it. I'll look into it and see what I can
do."</p>

<p>We chatted awhile, then I hung up. Well, I've warned the
authorities. As chief scientist of the National Computer<a id="p342"
name="p342"></a> Security Center, Bob had a few hours to rouse his
troops and begin figuring out what this virus was all about. I stared
at my computer screen for a while, then, clad in a bathrobe, fell
asleep on the keyboard.</p>

<p>Two hours later the phone rang. It's Don Alvarez from MIT on the
line.</p>

<p>"Hey, Cliff," he says, "something weird is going on. There's a
hundred jobs running on our computer. Smells like a virus."</p>

<p>"You've got it too, huh?" We compared notes and quickly realized
that Unix systems across the country must be infected. There's not
much to do but patch the bugs in the systems.</p>

<p>"There are only two ways to understand this virus," Don said. "The
obvious way is to disassemble it. Follow the computer code, step by
step, and figure out what it does."</p>

<p>"OK," I said, "I've tried that, and it's not easy. What's the other
way?"</p>

<p>"Treat it as a black box. Watch it send signals to other computers,
and estimate what's inside of it."</p>

<p>"There's a third way, Don."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Find out who wrote it."</p>

<p>I scanned the computer network news: Peter Yee and Keith Bostic of
the University of California at Berkeley were unraveling the virus;
they described the Unix holes and even published a way to patch the
software. Well done!</p>

<p>Within the day, Jon Rochlis, Stan Zanarotti, Ted Ts'o, and Mark
Eichin of MIT were dissecting the program, translating the bits and
bytes into ideas. By Thursday evening&#8212; less than twenty-four
hours after the virus was released&#8212;the MIT and Berkeley groups
had disassembled the code and were well along to understanding it.</p>

<p>Mike Muuss of the Ballistics Research Lab was making progress,
too. Within a few hours, he built a test chamber for the virus and
used his software tools to prod it. From his experiments, he
understood how it spread, and which holes it used to infest other
computers.</p>

<p>But who wrote it?</p>

<p>Around eleven in the morning, someone from NSA's National Computer
Security Center called me.<a id="p343" name="p343"></a></p>

<p>"Cliff, we've just held a meeting about the virus," the voice
said. "I've got just one question for you: did you write the
virus?"</p>

<p>I was stunned. Me? Write this virus?</p>

<p>"No, damn it, I didn't write it. I've spent the past night trying
to extinguish it."</p>

<p>"A couple people at the meeting suggested that you were the most
likely creator. I'm just checking."</p>

<p>You've got to be joking. Me? What could make them think that I had
written it? Then I realized: I'd posted a message to their computer. I
was the first to call them. What paranoia!</p>

<p>Their call set me to thinking. Who had written the virus? Why? You
don't accidentally write a virus. This one had taken weeks to
build.</p>

<p>Late Thursday afternoon, I called Bob Morris back. "Any news?" I
asked him.</p>

<p>"For once, I'll tell you the truth," Bob said. "I know who wrote
the virus."</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Now that's efficient. Ten hours after I call them, the National
Computer Security Center has found the culprit.</p>

<p>But I hadn't. He's still a mystery to me, so it's back to snooping
around the networks. If I could only find the computer that had been
first infected. No, that won't work. There's thousands out there.</p>

<p>John Markoff, a reporter from the New York <em>Times,</em>
called. "I heard a rumor that the person who wrote the virus has the
initials RTM. Is that any help?"</p>

<p>"Not much, but I'll check it out."</p>

<p>How do you find someone from his initials? Of course . . . you look
him up in the network directory.</p>

<p>I log into the Network Information Center and search for anyone
with the initials RTM. One guy pops up: Robert T. Morris. Address:
Harvard University, Aiken Laboratory.</p>

<p>Aiken. I've heard of that. It's three blocks from my house. I think
I'll stroll by.</p>

<p>I pull on a coat and walk along Kirkland Street, then over to
Oxford Street, where the sidewalks are brick. Across the street from
Harvard's Cyclotron Laboratory, there's a lunch<a id="p344"
name="p344"></a> truck selling Middle Eastern food. A hundred feet
away, Aiken Computer Lab&#8212;an ugly modern concrete building
surrounded by old Victorian masterpieces.</p>

<p>I walk up to a secretary. "Hi. I'm looking for Robert Morris."</p>

<p>"Never heard of him," she says. "But I'll check my machine." She
types into her terminal,</p>

<pre>
Finger Morris
</pre>

<p>Her computer responds:</p>

<pre>
Login name: rtm In real life: Robert T. Morris Phone: 617/498-8847
Last login Thu Nov 3 00:85 on ttyp2 from 128.84.264.126
</pre>

<p>Well&#8212;the last time that Robert Morris used the Harvard
computer was twenty-five minutes after midnight, on the morning that
the virus struck. But he's not here in Massachusetts. That address,
128.84.254.126, is at Cornell University. He entered the Harvard
system from a computer at Cornell University. Curious.</p>

<p>The secretary sees the message, looks up, and says, "Oh, he must
have once been a student here. That phone number is in Room 111.</p>

<p>I wander over to room 111 and knock on the door. A student in a
T-shirt peers out. "Ever hear of Robert Morris?" I ask.</p>

<p>His face blanches. "Yeah. He's not here anymore." And he slams the
door in my face.</p>

<p>I walk away, think for a moment, then return. "Have you heard about
the virus?" I ask the guy at the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, RTM wouldn't have done that. I'm sure."</p>

<p>Wait a second. I hadn't even asked if Morris had written the virus
and this guy's denying it. There's an easy way to test this guy's
veracity. "When's the last time that Morris has used Harvard's
computers?"</p>

<p>"Last year, when he was a student. He's at Cornell now, and he
doesn't log into our computer anymore."</p>

<p>This guy's story doesn't jibe with the accounting
records<a id="p345" name="p345"></a> of his computer. One of 'em's
telling the truth. I'll bank on the computer.</p>

<p>We talked for five minutes, and this guy tells me how he's a good
friend of Morris, how they were officemates together, and how RTM
would never write a computer virus.</p>

<p>"Yeah, right," I'm thinking.</p>

<p>I leave, thinking that Morris's old officemate is covering for
him. Morris must be talking to this guy, and they're both
frightened. I'd be scared, too, in that squeeze. Half the country's
looking for the creator of this virus.</p>

<p>Where did the virus start from? I checked other computers in
Cambridge, searching for connections to Cornell. One machine, over at
MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab, showed late-night connections from
Robert Morris's computer at Cornell.</p>

<p>Now things made sense. The virus was designed and built at
Cornell. Then the creator used the Arpanet to connect to MIT and
release the virus there. A while later he panics when he realizes that
his creature is out of control. So he logs into the Harvard computer,
either to check on the virus's progress, or to ask his friends for
help.</p>

<p>The joke was on me, though. It didn't occur to me that Robert
T. Morris, Jr., was the son of Bob . . . er, Robert Morris, Sr. Yeah,
son of Bob Morris, who only yesterday told me he'd known of
the <em>Sendmail</em> hole for years. Bob Morris, the head honcho
who'd grilled me on astrophysics, then nearly asphyxiated me with
cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>So Bob Morris's son froze two thousand computers. Why? To impress
his dad? As a Halloween prank? To show off to a couple thousand
computer programmers?</p>

<p>Whatever his purposes were, I don't believe he was in cahoots with
his father. Rumors have it that he worked with a friend or two at
Harvard's computing department (Harvard student Paul Graham sent him
mail asking for "Any news on the brilliant project"), but I doubt his
father would encourage anyone to create a virus. As Bob Morris, Sr.,
said, "This isn't exactly a good mark for a career at NSA."</p>

<p>After dissecting the code, MIT's Jon Rochlis characterized the
virus as "not very well written." It was unique in that it attacked
computers through four pathways: Bugs in<a id="p346" name="p346"></a>
the Unix <em>Sendmail</em> and Finger programs, guessing passwords,
and by exploiting paths of trust between computers. In addition,
Morris camouflaged the program in several ways, so as to avoid
detection. But he made several programming mistakes&#8212;like setting
the wrong replication rate&#8212; and the worm probably could have
been written by many students or programmers.</p>

<p>All it takes is knowledge of Unix flaws and no sense of
responsibility.</p>

<p>Once you understand how this particular worm-virus infests
computers, the cure becomes evident: repair <em>Sendmail</em> and the
finger daemon, change the passwords, and erase all the copies of the
system's virus. Evident, yes. Easy, no.</p>

<p>Spreading the word isn't easy when everyone's chopping off their
electronic mail system. After all, that's how this worm propagates its
children. Slowly, using alternate networks and telephone calls, the
word went out. Within a couple days, Morris's worm was pretty much
squashed.</p>

<p>But how do I protect against other viruses? Things aren't so
hopeful. Since viruses masquerade as sections of legitimate programs,
they're tough to detect. Worse, once your system is infected, these
are difficult beasts to understand. A programmer has to decompile the
code: a time-consuming, boring job.</p>

<p>Fortunately, computer viruses are rare. Although it's become
fashionable to blame system problems on viruses, they mostly hit
people who exchange software and use computer bulletin
boards. Fortunately, these are usually knowledgeable people who make
backup copies of their disks.</p>

<p>A computer virus is specialized: a virus that works on an IBM PC
cannot do anything to a Macintosh or a Unix computer. Similarly, the
Arpanet virus could only strike at systems running Berkeley
Unix. Computers running other operating systems&#8212;like AT&amp;T
Unix, VMS, or DOS&#8212;were totally immune.</p>

<p>Diversity, then, works against viruses. If all the systems on the
Arpanet ran Berkeley Unix, the virus would have disabled all fifty
thousand of them. Instead, it infected only a couple
thousand. Biological viruses are just as specialized: we can't catch
the flu from dogs.<a id="p347" name="p347"></a></p>

<p>Bureaucrats and managers will forever urge us to standardize on a
single type of system: "Let's only use Sun workstations" or "Only buy
IBM systems." Yet somehow our communities of computers are a diverse
population&#8212; with Data General machines sitting next to Digital
Vaxes; IBMs connected to Sonys. Like our neighborhoods, electronic
communities thrive through diversity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, how much astronomy was I doing?</p>

<p>None. For thirty-six hours, I worked on disinfecting our
computers. Then came meetings and then papers to write. And a couple
copycat virus makers&#8212;fortunately, none as clever as the
original.</p>

<p>The last I heard, Robert T. Morris was laying low, avoiding
interviews and wondering about the chances of an indictment. His
father's still at NSA, still the chief scientist at their computer
security center.</p>

<p>How much damage was done? I surveyed the network, and found that
two thousand computers were infected within fifteen hours. These
machines were dead in the water&#8212; useless until disinfected. And
removing the virus often took two days.</p>

<p>Suppose someone disabled two thousand automobiles, say, by letting
the air out of their tires. How would you measure the damage? By one
measure, there's been no damage at all: the cars are intact, and all
you need to do is pump some air.</p>

<p>Or you can measure damage by the loss of the cars. Let's see: how
much do you lose if your car is disabled for a day? The cost of
sending a tow truck out? Or the price of a rental car? Or the amount
of work that you've lost? Hard to say.</p>

<p>Perhaps you'd thank the person who let the air out of your
tires&#8212;award him a medal for raising your consciousness about
automotive security.</p>

<p>Here, someone crippled some two thousand computers for two
days. What was lost? Programmers, secretaries, and managers couldn't
work. Data wasn't collected. Projects were delayed.</p>

<p>The virus writer caused that much damage at least. Deeper damage,
too. A while after the virus hit, some astronomers and programmers
took a poll. Some of the computer people felt the virus was a harmless
prank&#8212;one of the finest jokes ever.<a id="p348"
name="p348"></a></p>

<p>The astronomers had a different opinion: for two days, they
couldn't work. Their secretaries and grad students weren't
working. Proposals and papers weren't being written. We pay for their
network connections out of our pockets&#8212;and this caper made it
even more difficult to expand their astronomy networks.</p>

<p>Some programmers see this virus as a useful exercise in raising
consciousness about computer security. The virus writer should be
thanked. Yeah, sure. Like going into a small town and breaking into
people's homes, so as to impress upon the townsfolk the need to buy
strong locks.</p>

<p>Once, I too would have seen no mischief in this virus. But over the
past two years, my interest changed from a micro-problem (a 75-cent
discrepancy) to macro-issues: the welfare of our networks, a sense of
common fair play, legal implications of hacking, the security of
defense contractors, commonweal ethics in computing . . .</p>

<p>Omigod! Listening to myself talk like this, <em>I</em> realize that
I've become a grown-up (sob!)&#8212;a person who <em>really has a
stake.</em> My graduate student mentality of earlier days let me think
of the world as just a research project: to be studied, data
extracted, patterns noted. Suddenly there are conclusions to be drawn;
conclusions that carry moral weight.</p>

<p>I guess I've come of age.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>The greatest B-movie of all time, <em>The Blob,</em> finishes off
with the malignant monster being towed off to Antarctica: it's
harmless when frozen. Then, the words "The End" flash across the
screen, but at the last minute, a blob-shaped question mark
appears. The monster isn't dead, only sleeping.</p>

<p>That is how I felt when I finally dismantled my monitors, made the
last entry in my logbook, and said good-bye to midnight chases after
Markus Hess.</p>

<p>The monster is still out there, ready to come alive again. Whenever
someone, tempted by money, power, or simple curiosity, steals a
password and prowls the networks. Whenever someone forgets that the
networks she loves to play on are fragile, and can only exist when
people trust each other. Whenever a fun-loving student breaks into
systems as a game (as I might once have done), and forgets that
he's<a id="p349" name="p349"></a> invading people's privacy,
endangering data that others have sweated over, sowing distrust and
paranoia.</p>

<p>Networks aren't made of printed circuits, but of people. Right now,
as I type, through my keyboard I can touch countless others: friends,
strangers, enemies. I can talk to a physicist in Japan, an astronomer
in England, a spy in Washington. I might gossip with a buddy in
Silicon Valley or some professor at Berkeley.</p>

<p>My terminal is a door to countless, intricate pathways, leading to
untold numbers of neighbors. Thousands of people trust each other
enough to tie their systems together. Hundreds of thousands of people
use those systems, never realizing the delicate networks that link
their separate worlds.</p>

<p>Like the innocent small town invaded in a monster movie, all those
people work and play, unaware of how fragile and vulnerable their
community is. It could be destroyed outright by a virus, or, worse, it
could consume itself with mutual suspicion, tangle itself up in locks,
security checkpoints, and surveillance; wither away by becoming so
inaccessible and bureaucratic that nobody would want it anymore.</p>

<p>But maybe, if Hess was an exception, if enough of us work together
to keep the networks safe and free, this will all be over. I can
finally get back to astronomy and have time to spend with my
long-suffering bride. I don't want to be a computer cop. I don't want
our networks to need cops.</p>

<p>The phone's ringing. It's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory&#8212; a
place I've stayed away from because they design nuclear bombs. A
hacker's breaking into their computer. They want my help. They think
I'm a wizard.</p>

<br />
<center><strong>THE END</strong><br />
 <strong>?</strong></center>

<a id="p350" name="p350"></a>

<h3>After the Question Mark</h3>

<p class="first">I couldn't get back to astronomy that easily. A year
after moving to Cambridge, my boss still noticed that I was spending
time on computer security. "And not enough on astronomy ..." he
added.</p>

<p>Seems that hackers were hunting for me. Anonymous phone calls,
threatening letters, nasty electronic mail. People from various
three-letter agencies still call. Meanwhile, several individuals wound
up in court.</p>

<p>The past year's been hard. Martha has a clerkship at the Supreme
Court in Washington: Zooks! But our jobs seem to pull in different
directions, so we've been living apart. Her days are spent in
lawbooks, mine behind a keyboard in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Plenty to do at the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory. Bread and butter astronomy: making databases from the
high energy astrophysics satellites and connecting a Sun workstation
to an X-ray telescope.</p>

<p>Yes, looking at the sky through a telescope is a real charge, but
the challenge is to analyze what's there. Suppose you compare the
X-ray sky with observations taken through radio telescopes. Plenty of
stars give off radio waves. But those objects that show up in both
wavelengths might be colliding galaxies.</p>

<p>To search for these, we needed to compare a half-dozen
databases. For me, that means programming a Unix computer. Once again,
I'm half astronomer, half programmer.</p>

<p>December 1989 letter from the German Oberlandesgericht Court in
Celle: "You are respectfully requested to appear at the trial of
M. Hess, D. Brysinski, and P. Carl."</p>

<p>Charge: espionage.</p>

<p>Celle is an old town half an hour outside of Hannover . . . Houses
from 1550, cobblestone streets, a 200-year-old castle, and the Federal
district courthouse.</p>

<p>The trial wasn't like the old Perry Mason shows. There<a id="p351"
name="p351"></a> were three days of testimony, all
double-translated. A panel of five judges asked questions. The defense
attorneys asked questions. The defendants asked questions. The
prosecutor remained silent.</p>

<p>How did I feel? Nervous, yet confident in my research. My logbook
made all the difference. It was like presenting some observations to a
room of astronomers. They may disagree with the interpretation, but
they can't argue with what you saw. Still, this wasn't science. I
looked across the room and saw three worried guys trying desperately
to stay out of prison. In the hallway I heard Peter Carl, the former
croupier, telling how good he felt helping the KGB because someone's
got to even things out with the CIA. He explained that he carried a
gun that he "found in the street."</p>

<p>There was Markus Hess: round faced, slightly overweight, and
balding. Chain-smoking Benson and Hedges in the hallway, he admitted
that he'd broken into our computers. Some military systems, too. And,
yes, he'd sold certain software to the KGB.</p>

<p>As last, here was my adversary, yet I didn't know what to
say. Before meeting him, I'd watched him for a year. I already knew
him and had classified him as a reptile.</p>

<p>But my opinions softened a bit face-to-face. Up close, well, here
was a guy that knew that he'd screwed up and was squirming to
escape. Throughout the trial, Hess knew what was incriminating, and
tried to chip away at my testimony: Why were some sessions missing
from my printouts? Could I prove that nobody else had seen those bogus
SDINET files? Might other hackers have been responsible for the theft
of this data?</p>

<p>Those missing sessions were from paper jams and disk
overflows. Yes, I could tell the difference between the hacker using
the Hunter/Jaeger/Sventek accounts and others just playing around. And
my alarms alerted me every time anyone touched those sensitive
files.</p>

<p>The trial was tough, but afterward I met some computer programmers
and not-quite-hackers from Hannover. They showed me Hess's old
apartment on Glockenstrasse, across the street from a community
theater. Two years earlier, they'd held regular hacker meetings to
compare notes, exchange passwords, and plan future attacks. Now,
though,<a id="p352" name="p352"></a> they were staying clear of
others' systems: Hagbard's death and Hess's arrest had made an
impact.</p>

<p>On February 15, 1990, Hess, Brysinski, and Carl were found guilty
of espionage and received one- to two-year sentences. Released on
probation, they are now free in Germany. Markus Hess now writes
networking software for a company in Hannover.</p>

<p>Back on this side of the ocean, Robert T. Morris went on trial in
January 1990 for writing the infamous Internet worm that froze
thousands of computers. The federal prosecutor pointed out that Morris
had written his program specifically to break into computers. Was
there a programming error? Well, yes&#8212;his worm wasn't supposed to
infect thousands of computers overnight. Rather, it was supposed to
happen over a period of weeks, months, and even years. If his code had
worked properly, the Morris virus would still be infesting computers
today.</p>

<p>The jury in Syracuse found Morris guilty of a felony&#8212;the
first conviction for writing a computer virus. On May 4, the judge
sentenced him to three years of probation, 400 hours of community
service, and a $10,000 fine.</p>

<p>A fair sentence? I'd say so. A prison term wouldn't do much except
satisfy a desire for revenge. Community service is certainly
appropriate, considering that his worm program was an attack on a most
delicate community.</p>

<p>Special Agent Mike Gibbons is now at FBI headquarters in
Washington. Yow&#8212;maybe the system works: A competent FBI special
agent is setting policy.</p>

<p>Martha? Working at the Supreme Court and practicing aikido daily
. . . got her black belt a few months ago. Sure do miss her.</p>

<p>Without Martha, chocolate chip cookies weren't much fun to
make. Instead of gardening, I'd spend Sunday afternoons at work. So at
1:30, March 11, I biked over to the Smithsonian Observatory, looked at
my Sun workstation, and noticed something weird. My electronic mail
files had been read at 12:57. But I'd been asleep then. Someone had
been messing with my files. Reading my network mail. Changing
passwords.</p>

<p>Someone's broken in and become super-user. Left a message for me
too: "Now the cuckoo has egg on his face."<a id="p353"
name="p353"></a> Out to prove he's the fastest gunslinger in the
west.</p>

<p>Please, not again.</p>

<p>But sure enough, my lab director ordered our system isolated from
the network. For the next two weeks, we scoured our systems software,
finding Trojan horses and backdoor passwords that this hacker had left
behind. Whee!</p>

<p>He got in through an unprotected astronomy computer run by a couple
of infrared astronomers. They didn't care about security . . . they
just needed to connect to the network. Because I exchange programs
with them, we'd set up our systems to work as one&#8212;you didn't
need a password to move from their computer to mine.</p>

<p>This hacker guessed a password for their Unix system. From there,
he became super-user by planting an egg in the systems area, then
sliding into my computer.</p>

<p>A couple days later the SOB called me. Said his name was Dave. From
Australia. "I broke in to show that your security isn't very
good."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to secure my computer," I replied. "I trust other
astronomers."</p>

<p>Dave had other reasons for breaking in, too. "You think that
hackers are bad. This proves otherwise."</p>

<p>"Huh? You break into my computer to show that hackers are
good?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Dave replied. "We're helping you out by finding your
security faults."</p>

<p>If you tell some kids that they're behaving like children, they'll
get even with you by acting like children.</p>

<p>Last I heard, the Secret Service, FBI, and the Australian police
had tracked down three Australian hackers. Charged with theft of
telephone service and breaking into computers, they are out on
bail. One of them is named Dave.</p>

<p>Hey&#8212;the Hubble Space Telescope is in orbit. And the Keck
Observatory in Hawaii is nearly finished . . . another nifty telescope
that I'd like to write software for. I could have been helping out
except that I've been chasing&#8212;and being chased
by&#8212;hackers. I wonder if there's room there for an astronomer
who's occasionally mistaken for a computer wizard?<a id="p354"

<h3>Bibliography</h3>

<p>If you'd like the technical details behind this book, read my
article, "Stalking the Wily Hacker," in the May 1988 issue of
the <em>Communications of the ACM.</em> It's an academic paper which
highlights the techniques that the hacker used to break into
computers.</p>

<p>In addition, I described how to track hackers in "What Do You Feed
a Trojan Horse?"&#8212;found in the <em>Proceedings of the 10th
National Computer Security Conference</em> (September 1987). Because I
wrote that paper while the hacker was still actively breaking into
computers, it's about how to trace networks and doesn't mention our
problems.</p>

<p>For more details about the NSA and a bit about their computer
security problems, read <em>The Puzzle Palace</em> by James
Bamford. Bamford describes the tug of war between the code makers and
code breakers&#8212;he must have had fun prying those details out of
the super-secret agency. David Kahn's book, <em>The Codebreakers,</em>
is a fascinating description and history of ciphers, which suggests
how computers use cryptography to protect their data. In <em>Deep
Black</em> William E. Burrows writes mostly about secret observations
from spy satellites, but also hints at the use of computers in
espionage.</p>

<p>For more mundane, yet valuable descriptions of the problems and
techniques of computer security, read <em>Defending Secrets, Sharing
Data,</em> available from the U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
Assessment, OTA-CIT-310. For a still more technical discussion,
try <em>Cryptography and Data Security</em> by Dorothy Denning. The
hacker probably wouldn't have broken into our system had we read (and
applied) <em>Unix System Security</em> by Wood and Kochan. There's a
superb report by David Curry: "Improving the Security of Your Unix
System." The name says it all&#8212;ask for report ITSTD-721-FR-90-21
from SRI International, 333 Ravens-wood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA
94025.</p>

<p>Computer security problems are usually heard first on<a id="p355"
name="p355"></a> Internet and Usenet network conferences. These are
world-wide electronic bulletin boards&#8212;this is often where first
rumors of trouble show up. To hear about the latest computer security
problems, watch the <em>Unix-wizards, Info-vax, Security, TCP-IP</em>
and <em>Virus-L</em> conferences, where participants discuss social
issues relating to computers. There are a few private security
conferences as well; their &#8220;invitation only&#8221; membership is
indicative of the paranoia surrounding the field. There are also
anonymous and pirate bulletin boards; these seldom have much useful
information&#8212;but they do tell you what one segment of the
population is thinking.<a id="p356" name="p356"></a></p>

<p><a id="fn9" name="fn9" href="#ret9">[*]</a>What word describes
someone who breaks into computers? Old style software wizards are
proud to be called hackers, and resent the scofflaws who have
appropriated the word. On the networks, wizards refer to these
hoodlums of our electronic age as "crackers" or "cyberpunks." In the
Netherlands, there's the term "computervredebreuk"&#8212;literally,
computer peace disturbance. Me? The idea of a vandal breaking into my
computer makes me think of words like "varmint," "reprobate," and
"swine."</p>

doesn't have one central switch, but instead has many local switches,
all around the country. The lowest-level switches (really, computers)
are tied together, forming local networks. These, in turn, are grouped
together into regional networks, which connect to national
backbones. The Internet, then, connects networks together&#8212;like
the Arpanet, the Milnet, and its hundred other networks.</p>

<p>While Tymnet (and its many cousins) builds virtual circuits from
one point to another, the Internet is hierarchical. An Internet
message moves from local roads, to state roads, onto the highways, and
then down through state roads to a specific street address.</p>

<p>Envelopes for messages on Tymnet can be simple&#8212;once the
virtual circuit is established, each node knows where to toss the
message. Internet messages, however, have envelopes with complete
destination and return addresses, so that each network can figure out
how to send it one step closer to the ultimate destination. Those more
complex envelopes let Internet packets get through even when the
system's congested.</p>

<p>Which is better? Don't ask me.</p>
